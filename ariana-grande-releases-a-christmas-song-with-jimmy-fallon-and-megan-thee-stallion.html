They’ve hinted at a special surprise during interviews and during <a href=#>That’s My Jam</a>, but now the secret is out. Fallon teamed up with Grande and Megan Thee Stallion to release the hilarious holiday hit: “It Was A…<a href=#>(Masked Christmas)</a>.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jimmy-fallon-teams-up-with-ariana-grande-and-megan-thee-stallion-for-star-studded-christmas-track>Jimmy Fallon Teams up With Ariana Grande and Megan Thee Stallion for Star Studded Christmas Track</h2><p>Fallon is quite the jokester on both The Tonight Show and That’s My Jam, so no one expected this song to be serious. The song talks about how last christmas many people were stuck inside and this year people are lining up for their vaccine booster. This tune also talks about how they’ll be doing things that they weren’t able to do last year, like kissing people and being unmasked.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>There’s so much to talk about with this video. To begin, Fallon always sings on The Tonight Show, and he’s the one singing the chorus throughout this tune. Many fans in the comment section of this song were impressed with just how good Fallon’s voice actually is.</p><p>“I know that Jimmy can sing, he’s using his skills to comedy stuff and bits. But this? Omg his real voice is amazing, he sounds like an angel” one fan wrote in the <a href=#>YouTube video</a> comments.</p><p>On top of Fallon’s angelic voice, Grande sounds and looks absolutely amazing in this. Even though Grande mostly performs backup vocals in this song, she’s still heard and loved. Within the music video, she rocked her recent signature ponytail with an airbrushed glowy makeup look. As always, your eyes gravitate right toward Grande in the video.</p><p>Meanwhile, Megan Thee Stallion has an epic verse in the middle of the song where she highlights that this year we won’t be quarantined “on the couch.” To add to the camp of it all, the star is dressed as a nurse with long nails that are actually syringes. She’s ready to hand out those vaccines.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did These Pop Stars Know Each Other Before This Collaboration?</h2><p>This is not the first time that Grande has collaborated with Megan Thee Stallion and it’s obvious it won’t be the last. In 2020, Grande collaborated with both Megan Thee Stallion and Doja Cat for a remix of her hit single, “<a href=#>34 + 35</a>.” When the music video for this remix dropped, many fans loved how authentically happy the women all were around each other. Many fans commented on the video saying they weren’t just acting.</p><p>The vibe in “It Was A… (Masked Christmas)” is extremely similar. Each star looks like they’re genuinely having a good time. Although there are a lot of moments where they are clearly acting, it’s obvious they had fun on set. Fans are hoping to see a behind the scenes video from the shoot. I wouldn’t be surprised if this is already in the works since Grande and Fallon talked so highly about this ‘secret project’ before releasing it.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.52.jpg alt="Blake Shelton Jokes He’s a ‘Deadbeat Husband’ to Gwen Stefani" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKugmqaRYrSzrc2dnGaqlaGyor%2FErGSaZZOdv6q%2F06aYrGWjpLuoedaiq6Flmp66rsWMn5ilpJ%2BjeqK6w2aknp%2BRo3q1tMSeZKyskaG5qrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
