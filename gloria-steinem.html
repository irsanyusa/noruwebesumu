Steinem was a prominent figure in the fight for women's rights and played a pivotal role in shaping feminist discourse and activism in the United States.</p><p>Steinem began her career in journalism in New York City in the early 1960s. She first gained attention in 1963 with her article, "A Bunny's Tale," based on her time working at a <a href=#>Playboy Club</a>. It was her 1969 article, "After Black Power, Women's Liberation," however, which really catapulted her into the limelight as a nationally-known figure.</p><p>In 1971, Steinem co-founded the National Women's Political Caucus, which was established to support women seeking political office. This was part of a broader effort to amplify women's voices within the political realm for more equitable representation.</p><p>Steinem was also a co-founder of the magazine Ms. in 1971. This publication was one of the first to address issues from a feminist perspective, covering a wide range of topics from politics and society to personal experiences. It provided a platform for feminist voices and became an influential medium in the women's liberation movement.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>March 25</a>, <a href=#>1934</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Toledo, Ohio, USA<br><b>Age: <a href=#>90 years old</a></b></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Silent Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Dog</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aries</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1963-05-01</a> Gloria Steinem's exposé, "A Bunny's Tale", on the working conditions for waitresses (bunnies) at New York City’s famed <a href=#>Playboy Club</a>, published in "Show" magazine</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1971-07-10</a> National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) founded in US by women including Bella Abzug, <a href=#>Betty Friedan</a>, <a href=#>Shirley Chisholm</a>, Myrlie Evers-Williams and Gloria Steinem</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1971-12-20</a> First preview issue of "Ms." magazine is published in the US launched by Gloria Steinem</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1972-07-01</a> Feminist magazine "Ms" founded by Gloria Steinem publishes its first regular issue with Wonder Woman on the cover</li></ul><h2>Personal Life</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2000-09-03</a> American feminist and journalist Gloria Steinem (66) weds environmentalist David Bale (59) in Adair County, Oklahoma</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Journalists</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJws8uoqaKZXajBprXNnqQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
