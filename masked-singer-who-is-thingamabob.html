And one of the cuddliest new characters is undoubtedly Thingamabob. His furry costume and solid voice make him one of the favorites already this season.</strong></p><p>So who is under the mask? Here are all the clues for Thingamabob, plus our celebrity prediction.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-bba56fdc-1613-4f63-a943-7d4ef6fb3cee>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 7</h2><p>In Thingamabob’s clues, we see a him in a forest with a “HOTEL CALIFORNIA” ornament hanging from a tree. It mentions being “taken from its natural habitat” and how it “now has to fend for itself.” The Bulldog from last season (Nick Cannon) enters with a tackle box and fishing net in his hands. But then, they hug and Bulldog drops two big coins into a jar that says “SAVE THE THINGAMABOB” with a picture of a bell on it.</p><p>A bald eagle soars across the screen. Thingamabob cries out three tears from his eyes while the narrator says it’s “one of a kind.” The clue package ends by asking for donations and saying that a portion of the proceeds go to Robin Thicke’s wardrobe.</p><p>Prior to the season, we also saw a photo of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as a clue for Thingamabob.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-aed0ca83-5ae3-4549-9411-272b33f78a6d>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Thingamabob</h2><p>Ken thought Thingamabob was Metallica’s lead singer, James Hatfield. Jenny McCarthy went with wrestler Chris Jericho. And Robin Thicke guessed it might be former football player Terrell Owens.</p><p>Online, the predictions are all over the place. The most popular ones are Joe Walsh or Don Henley from the Eagles band, Jordan Mailata or Jason Kelce from the Eagles football team, Jamie Foxx, Michael Bolton, and Huey Lewis.</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-826093eb-7e1a-4dd7-a946-3dce54548dda><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;SEASON 7 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-dbd3758a-2c07-4407-884a-af68d22f49c4>Who is Thingamabob on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Now this was a harder celebrity to figure out, but the ties to Eagles throughout the clue package helped direct the search. And with all the similarities to Thingamajig, we thought it might be another athlete who people don’t know can sing. That’s when we found the perfect answer!</p><p>So now we can safely say that The Masked Singer Thingamabob is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eb4a6776-9b31-44f2-8abe-d267d1b20c62>Jordan Mailata from the Philadelphia Eagles<strong>!</strong></h2><p>You read it here first! Jordan is an <a href=#>incredible singer</a>, and now he’s getting to share his voice with fans everywhere. Here are all the clues that led us to him.</p><p>Most obviously, we saw a few Eagles clues, including the Hotel California ornament and a bald eagle. He’s also significantly taller than Nick Cannon at 6’8″, so that explains how huge he is. Thingamabob also mentioned being out of his natural habitat and fending for himself. Jordan is originally from Australia and got scouted to come to the US to play football.</p><p>In his clues, we saw the Bulldog from last season. Jordan used to play rugby and was selected for Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs’ Under 18s team. We also saw a “tackle box,” which is a nod to his football position: offensive tackle. The clue with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson also makes sense for Jordan Mailata, because they are both of Samoan heritage. Finally, his song choice also gave him away, because Jordan’s favorite musician is Bon Jovi!</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;CYCLOPS</a></strong> | <strong><a href=#>FIREFLY</a></strong> | <strong><a href=#>RAM</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Caleb-Friend-in-Me.jpg alt="7 Things to Know About ‘American Idol’ Season 16 Winner Caleb Lee Hutchinson" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BippeWuqKuzptm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
