Scott Rudin came up&nbsp;with the idea when he&nbsp;was driving in&nbsp;the car together with the head of&nbsp;the movie company, and the kid of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the employees started singing the tune from <i>The Addams Family</i> series. The next day, they decided to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;film. But the filming and preparations were incredibly hard.</p><p><h2>The hardships the actress who played Morticia Addams had to&nbsp;endure</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/336/c58/39b9cd527bb4b0f1d4edc58a5e.jpg><ul><li>The actress that played Morticia probably had the toughest job. To&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>make</a> her already slim body even slimmer, she had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;metal corset every day that made her waist narrower and raised her breasts. It&nbsp;was unpleasant to&nbsp;wear, but this form of&nbsp;Morticia became iconic.</li><li>According to&nbsp;costume designer Ruth Myers, <strong>Morticia was supposed to&nbsp;move like a&nbsp;creature from the other world</strong>. It&nbsp;was quite easy to&nbsp;achieve: the corset made sure the actress could barely walk. She mostly had to&nbsp;slide.</li><li>To&nbsp;imitate her squinted eyes, they would attach pieces of&nbsp;fabric to&nbsp;the temples to&nbsp;stretch the skin and outer corners of&nbsp;the eyes. The fabric pieces were attached to&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;the head with tape. If&nbsp;the actress didn’t remove them during lunch, she’d have bad headaches and a&nbsp;skin rash. And if&nbsp;she did, she’d need to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spend</a> additional hours in&nbsp;the makeup room. Despite all the challenges, she didn’t complain. And it&nbsp;wasn’t until the last day of&nbsp;filming that she freaked out and burned both the corset and the wig.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/322/e6a/07be495ae894879b34b67d5bce.jpg><ul><li>The role of&nbsp;Morticia could have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gone</a> to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Cher data-link=tag>Cher</a> or&nbsp;Kim <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Basinger</a>, but it&nbsp;finally went to&nbsp;Anjelica Huston, as&nbsp;they’d been impressed by&nbsp;this grim beautiful woman for a&nbsp;long time.</li><li>Ruth Myers got an&nbsp;Oscar nomination for the costumes she created. Because the Addams family consisted of&nbsp;aristocrats, she had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>develop</a> 20&nbsp;dresses just for Morticia alone.</li><li>Morticia had a&nbsp;daytime dress she’d wear around lunchtime before changing into her dinner dress. The latter was jet with beautiful lace. “Jet” refers to&nbsp;a&nbsp;semi-precious black stone made of&nbsp;coal. It&nbsp;was often used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;replacement for diamonds and colored stones during periods of&nbsp;mourning in&nbsp;the Victorian era. They used a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;vintage satin along with some velvet and chiffon.</li></ul><p><h2>How Wednesday Addams was created</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9bb/d57/7cbec95b71b60c7fbef504fc44.png><ul><li>Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday, the daughter of&nbsp;the family, was just as&nbsp;cunning as&nbsp;her character when she was a&nbsp;kid. She said that at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;8, she wanted a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;school play but it&nbsp;went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy. She’d <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mock</a> him until he&nbsp;attacked her. Ricci complained about him, got the part, and was noticed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;local theater critic.</li><li>Like Morticia, Wednesday had several dresses: one for school, one for every day, and one for the evening. She had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mini-Morticia</a> dress for the ball sequence.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/815/316/519ae15aad99f14a73922e3563.png><ul><li>Christina Ricci <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>came up</a>&nbsp;with the sleep position of&nbsp;Wednesday with her arms crossed on&nbsp;her chest. The name Wednesday is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reference</a> to&nbsp;the line in&nbsp;the Mother Goose poem that goes, “Wednesday’s child is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;woe.”</li></ul><p><h2>The look of&nbsp;Uncle Fester</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a2/b6a/50093e525999dc7b88a422cd8b.jpg><p>Strong Heart Demme Production / Collection Christophel / East News<span>, </span>Columbia Tristar / Courtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection / East News</p><ul><li>Sir Anthony Hopkins <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>turned down</a> the role of&nbsp;Uncle Fester. Christopher Lloyd, famous for the <i>Back to&nbsp;the Future</i> trilogy, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>got</a> the role.</li><li>Before filming (spoiler alert!), it&nbsp;wasn’t decided yet if&nbsp;Gordon would be&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>real</a> brother of&nbsp;Gomez Addams or&nbsp;not. But the actors were so&nbsp;worried that Gordon would be&nbsp;an&nbsp;imposter that they asked Christina Ricci to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;the director and producer to&nbsp;make Gordon the real Uncle Fester. Ironically, the only person that didn’t care who the character would turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;was Christopher Lloyd himself.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f6/7d2/1c14d55559a50dab5076d06221.jpg><ul><li>When Uncle Fester arrives at&nbsp;the Addams’ house, his trunk <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bears</a> travel stickers from locations known for horrible events and disasters, including Elba, Jonestown, the Bermuda Triangle, Death Valley, the Black Hole of&nbsp;Calcutta, Three Mile Island, Alcatraz, Pompeii, Devil’s Island, and others.</li><li>Bruno Kirby <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offered</a> his fat suit from <i>The Godfather: Part&nbsp;II </i>(1974) to&nbsp;Christopher Lloyd so&nbsp;he&nbsp;could better portray Uncle Fester.</li></ul><p><h2>How a&nbsp;hand turned into a&nbsp;full-fledged character</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/207/259/68cf3654f8a09931a23258efcb.jpg><p>CAP / SFS / East News</p><ul><li>Another small but important movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>character</a> is&nbsp;the hand, named Thing. It&nbsp;belonged to&nbsp;actor-magician Christopher Hart. For most of&nbsp;Thing’s shots, Hart <strong>was laid facedown on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dolly and propelled through the set,</strong> one arm extended, and the rest of&nbsp;the body was hidden in&nbsp;a&nbsp;black suit.</li><li>In&nbsp;the 1964&nbsp;series, Thing didn’t have so&nbsp;much work: the hand would just appear from a&nbsp;box. But in&nbsp;the 1991&nbsp;movie, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;character that could write and talk by&nbsp;using Morse code, do&nbsp;some small tasks, and it&nbsp;even saved Uncle Fester’s life in&nbsp;the 1993&nbsp;sequel.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6b2/9a3/4928cf5536aefaf3a429f70b7d.png><ul><li>Some episodes with Thing were really difficult to&nbsp;shoot, like, for example when the hand <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>jumps</a> over the pond, it&nbsp;required stop-motion animation, a&nbsp;technique in&nbsp;which a&nbsp;puppet is&nbsp;moved a&nbsp;tiny bit at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time and photographed frame by&nbsp;frame. The scene, which runs less than 10&nbsp;seconds, took 8&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;shoot.</li><li>All the personal belongings Thing had were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hand-related</a>, like different types of&nbsp;gloves and handwear-themed catalogs and notebooks.</li></ul><p><h2>The casting process and how the other actors worked</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ed/a9d/5693095b3081b36718c2c8c08b.jpg><ul><li>Early makeup designs for Gomez Addams included <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dark circles</a> around his eyes, similar to&nbsp;Uncle Fester’s. But they changed it&nbsp;right before filming.</li><li>Jimmy Workman who played Pugsley, the Addams’ son, got his role <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accidentally</a>&nbsp;— he&nbsp;was with his older sister for her audition. But when she didn’t get the part and Ricci did, the director and producer noticed Jimmy on&nbsp;set and suggested he&nbsp;try out.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f1/6e0/f1a4ff5938af7addcf82be4334.jpg><ul><li>Mercedes McNab, who plays the Girl Scout selling her cookies, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>plays</a> Amanda Buckman in&nbsp;the sequel.</li></ul><p><h2>Behind the scenes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/129/06a/2001025ad0b69181141fd8f31a.jpg><ul><li>Barry Sonnenfeld made his directorial debut with <i>The Addams Family</i>. But it&nbsp;wasn’t his first movie project. He’d previously earned his stripes as&nbsp;a&nbsp;director of&nbsp;photography on&nbsp;the likes of<i>&nbsp;Big</i>,<i> Miser</i>y, and the brilliant <i>Miller’s Crossing</i>. So, of&nbsp;course, he&nbsp;knew his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>way around</a> a&nbsp;movie set.</li><li>Still, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very tough time for Sonnenfeld. For several weeks, he’d sleep only 15&nbsp;minutes a&nbsp;night and often had a&nbsp;cappuccino instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal meal. He&nbsp;went on&nbsp;like this until he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lost consciousness</a> one day when he&nbsp;was working. And after spending a&nbsp;day in&nbsp;the hospital, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;continue working.</li><li>The director had a&nbsp;small cameo in&nbsp;the film&nbsp;— he&nbsp;was the passenger on&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>model train</a> that a&nbsp;giant Gomez played with.</li></ul><p>What memories do&nbsp;you have of&nbsp;this film?
