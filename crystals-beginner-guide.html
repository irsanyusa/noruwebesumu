There’s a crystal for everything, and this ancient stone medicine has been used for over <a href=# rel=noopener>10,000 years</a> to enhance physical, mental, emotional and spiritual balance. Crystals are used for healing body aches, supporting emotional issues such as anxiety, calling romantic love into one’s life, manifesting goals, beauty rituals and balancing the energy of a space.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So who needs crystals, and how do you use them? Well, it all depends on your goals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first step to introducing crystals into your life is to acquire some crystals. However, before entering a crystal store or enlisting the help of a <a href=# rel=noopener>crystal expert</a>, you should ask yourself some simple questions, such as: What am I trying to work on right now? What do I want to call into my life? What’s holding me back from my dreams?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Once you’ve had an honest conversation with yourself, you can start to purchase some crystals. One option is to visit a gem mine and hand pick your stones, but a more practical approach is to start at your local metaphysical shop. There, you’ll want to ask the store owner where she or he acquires their stones. Knowing the lineage of a crystal is just like knowing where your food comes from. You want farm-to-table and cruelty-free. Everything carries an energy in it, and you want clear energies in your crystal, which is also why it’s important to give <a href=# rel=noopener>new crystals a “bath”</a> prior to using them for the first time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some of my favorite crystal haunts include <a href=# rel=noopener>Rock Star Crystals</a> in New York and <a href=# rel=noopener>Spellbound Sky</a> in Los Angeles. Average prices range from $2.00 to $100.00. This is a personal journey, and I strongly suggest only purchasing stones that you feel a personal connection to, but some good options to start with include:</p><li>Selenite — This clear crystal is like a cosmic vacuum cleaner and is best placed in your closet to help cleanse your belongings of old and negative energy</li><li>Black Tourmaline — Store this black gem under your bed or by your nightstand for grounding and protection</li><li>Scolecite — This opaque white stone is also best around your resting place and known for facilitating a good night’s rest</li><li>Citrine — Bring this orange-hued crystal to work as it’s known for calling business and financial success into one’s life</li><li>Amethyst — This purple stone can help deflect negative co-workers and their influences</li><li>Rose Quartz — Wear this light pink gem around your neck or place it in your purse, bra or pocket to help bring you self-acceptance, love and support throughout the day</li><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another great crystal to incorporate into your life is Iron Pyrite. It can you help you manifest any changes you’d like to see and is especially powerful around this time of year when everyone is setting <a href=#>New Year’s resolutions</a>. Simply write down all the things you’d like to receive and accomplish for the year, and put a piece of Iron Pyrite on top of your list. For the next 30 days, look at this list every day and recite it out loud. Our thoughts and actions manifest our reality, and it’s important to put energy behind the things that we want. You can also close your eyes and visualize these goals for extra credit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crystals can be powerful in helping your achieve your goals, and as shamans say, “Believe it and you will see it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>May you walk in beauty.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Colleen McCann is a fashion stylist-turned-shaman and the founder of <a href=# rel=noopener>Style Rituals</a>.
