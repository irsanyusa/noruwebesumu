In English, they’re called soap operas. They are famous for drama, romance, murder, back-stabbing villains, over-the-top acting, and low-budget production. In this article, we’ll go over how to learn Spanish by watching telenovelas and which are the four best telenovelas that we like to watch.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-learn-Spanish-by-watching-telenovelas>How to learn Spanish by watching telenovelas</h2><p>Telenovelas are amazing for listening practice in Spanish. The conversations are easy to follow and include important common phrasing. Here is one specific grammar lesson to improve your vocabulary.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mandatos (Orders)</h3><p>In Spanish, giving a direct order has a specific grammar change for the verb. It is not the same grammar as the normal present tense. Notice the difference:</p><ul><li>Present tense: Me sueltas. (You let me go.)</li><li>Mandato: ¡Suéltame! (Let go of me!)</li></ul><p>The mandato is a direct order to do something. In high-drama telenovelas, you will hear mandatos a lot.</p><ul><li>¡Déjame en paz! (Leave me alone!)</li><li>¡Díme la verdad! (Tell me the truth!)</li><li>¡No me dejes! (Don’t leave me!)</li></ul><p>Learning is about repetition so get into the drama. Shout your favorite mandatos while watching your telenovela.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Beginners, intermediate, & advanced student practice</h3><p>Beginners should always turn on English subtitles to understand what’s going on. Focus on getting the gist of the story. Listen to the accents and any keywords or phrases you recognize. Keep your viewing short, such as one episode of a TV series.</p><p>Intermediate students can turn on subtitles too, but in Spanish. This will help you read faster. Listen for intermediate grammar such as mandatos or the past tense. You are probably ready for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full-length movies in Spanish</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movies in Spanish on Netflix</a> as well.</p><p>Advanced students should turn off all subtitles. Focus on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slang and colloquial expressions</a> from the specific region or country of your favorite series.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-4-best-telenovelas-on-Netflix-and-YouTube>The 4 best telenovelas on Netflix and YouTube</h2><p>Telenovelas started being produced in the 1950s, over 70 years ago.
