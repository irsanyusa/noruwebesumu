Since welcoming her first child, she has had to&nbsp;overcome a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;difficult moments, including a&nbsp;life-threatening condition and postpartum depression. Still, she’s always open about her struggles, and her honest accounts reveal how her motherhood journey, thus far, has been both emotional and inspiring.</p><p><h2>Serena Williams is&nbsp;the proud mom of&nbsp;2&nbsp;daughters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e62/7e0/4652915ce8a2cbece57673dc56.jpg><p>Early in&nbsp;Serena Williams’ tennis <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> she never <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>considered</a> having children and later even expressed having reservations about bringing kids into a&nbsp;world riddled with problems. Plus, she thought it&nbsp;was likely that others would end up&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;her children, as&nbsp;she wasn’t particularly confident or&nbsp;comfortable around babies and kids then.</p><p>However, a&nbsp;lot changed as&nbsp;she grew older and found <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. On&nbsp;September&nbsp;1, 2017, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>welcomed</a> her first daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian&nbsp;Jr., alongside her husband, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alexis Ohanian</a> (known for being Reddit’s co-founder). Then, 6&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;August 2023, their family grew even bigger after Williams gave birth to&nbsp;their second daughter, Adira River Ohanian.</p><p>But becoming a&nbsp;mom brought on&nbsp;new challenges.</p><p><h2>She almost died after giving birth to&nbsp;her first child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c5/351/faad995035a28e1c9b34a12d3b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;poignant <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>essay</a> for <i>Elle</i> magazine, Williams recounted her challenging childbirth experience, highlighting how her 11-year awareness of&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-risk tendency to&nbsp;blood clots saved her life. Having previously suffered a&nbsp;serious pulmonary embolism in&nbsp;2011, she remained vigilant about her health. That’s why she immediately noticed symptoms of&nbsp;a&nbsp;clot emerge after childbirth.</p><p>In&nbsp;her harrowing account, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>detailed</a> how soon after giving birth by&nbsp;C-section she felt numbness in&nbsp;her legs and severe pain, and she realized she couldn’t move. Later&nbsp;on, she began breathing and coughing heavily (both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>symptoms</a> of&nbsp;blood clotting), which caused her stitches to&nbsp;burst and sent her back to&nbsp;the operating room.</p><p>When she woke&nbsp;up, she felt like she was “dying.” Despite her fear of&nbsp;passing out, Williams summoned the strength to&nbsp;leave her bed and find a&nbsp;nurse to&nbsp;address her concerns, shielding her mother from unnecessary worry. From then&nbsp;on, she’s had to&nbsp;advocate for herself and overcome multiple dismissals from healthcare providers in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;CAT scan of&nbsp;her lungs done.</p><p>After strongly insisting, a&nbsp;doctor agreed to&nbsp;it&nbsp;and proved Williams right. Her medical condition was complex, as&nbsp;multiple clots were discovered, and they eventually required several surgeries to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fully treated. The experience left her exhausted, as&nbsp;she “just wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with [her] baby,” and although it&nbsp;didn’t end tragically, the delay in&nbsp;her <a href=# title=diagnosis data-link=tag>diagnosis</a> led to&nbsp;her spending 7&nbsp;days in&nbsp;the hospital and enduring 6&nbsp;weeks of&nbsp;bed rest, taking an&nbsp;unimaginable emotional and physical toll on&nbsp;the new mom.</p><p><h2>She struggled with postpartum feelings of&nbsp;guilt.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b01/594/1d9dbc52f89d8cddf8e063049f.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>42-year-old</a> opened up&nbsp;about dealing with negative emotions shortly after birth, something she avoids referring to&nbsp;as&nbsp;postpartum depression and instead calls “postpartum emotions.” In&nbsp;a&nbsp;podcast, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> her careful choice of&nbsp;words, saying she wants to&nbsp;challenge the stigma associated with terms like “depression” and highlight that experiencing difficulties doesn’t necessarily equate to&nbsp;a&nbsp;clinical diagnosis.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;Instagram <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a> from August 2018, Williams shared a&nbsp;photo that captured an&nbsp;introspective moment at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cliff during a&nbsp;sunset, and the caption provided a&nbsp;personal reflection on&nbsp;those “postpartum emotions.” She expressed difficulties in&nbsp;navigating personal issues and feeling like she was not a&nbsp;good mom. Emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;<a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a>, she also stated that talking things through with her mom, sisters, and friends helped her realize that her feelings were normal.</p><p>She then went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;reassure fellow moms that it’s normal to&nbsp;feel like they’re not doing enough for their babies. Williams, who was balancing her tennis career with motherhood at&nbsp;the time, acknowledged the challenge of&nbsp;finding the right balance but pointed out that both stay-at-home and working moms face similar struggles.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time she addressed the downs in&nbsp;her emotional journey as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother though. In&nbsp;July of&nbsp;the same year, she took to&nbsp;Twitter to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>share</a> her frustration and sadness about missing her daughter’s first steps because she was training for Wimbledon. This incident highlights the sacrifices that athletes, particularly mothers, may face as&nbsp;they balance their careers with precious family moments.</p><p><h2>She moved on&nbsp;from playing tennis to&nbsp;prioritize motherhood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80b/07c/a0a7bb5c2a9c6f5456d806d821.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2020&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, Williams <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described </a>rushing home from her tennis matches, eager to&nbsp;see her daughter. For her, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;unparalleled joy hearing Olympia “squeal” with excitement upon seeing her.&nbsp;2&nbsp;years later, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> she would be&nbsp;taking a&nbsp;break from the sport.</p><p>In&nbsp;February 2023, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reaffirmed</a> her decision and stressed how content she was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;family life. Although a&nbsp;return to&nbsp;tennis would be&nbsp;difficult now, she recognizes her skill and is&nbsp;aware that she could be&nbsp;playing at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high level still.</p><p><h2>She doesn’t hold back from showing the less glamorous side of&nbsp;motherhood on&nbsp;social media.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b9/2bd/30d7285ba694f6d1ffdb5d1f3a.jpg><p>The tennis legend is&nbsp;very active on&nbsp;social media and never misses an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;candid glimpse into her real-life parenting experiences. In&nbsp;November 2023, she posted a&nbsp;lighthearted <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clip</a> on&nbsp;TikTok that perfectly captured the daily routine of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother.</p><p>The clip starts with Williams dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;glamorous black sequin gown, which she wore to&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appearance</a> at&nbsp;the 2023&nbsp;CFDA Awards. The scene then humorously transitions to&nbsp;a&nbsp;relatable mom moment as&nbsp;the camera reveals her pumping breast milk and sighing deeply. In&nbsp;the captions, Williams acknowledged that her life isn’t as&nbsp;glamorous as&nbsp;it&nbsp;may seem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e0/8e9/69d184503eb1f023c1baa5534f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the comment section, the video didn’t lack support. Many felt it&nbsp;was very accurate and proved that motherhood isn’t for the “weak,” as&nbsp;one user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>. Others were glad to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;famous person be&nbsp;down-to-earth enough to&nbsp;show the real behind-the-scenes, with someone saying, “If&nbsp;this isn’t real life, then&nbsp;I don’t know what&nbsp;is. So&nbsp;glad you show you’re in&nbsp;the trenches with&nbsp;us.”</p><p><h2>Despite the struggles, she loves being a&nbsp;mom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d5/6df/4753e45fb0af235f920e7ebd9f.jpg><p>Williams frequently shares insights into motherhood on&nbsp;Instagram, including the joys of&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2019&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>, she reflected on&nbsp;the first 2&nbsp;years of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;mom as&nbsp;her “greatest accomplishment.”</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2022 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with <i>Vogue</i>, she highlighted her hands-on approach to&nbsp;motherhood, expressing how she enjoys being intensely involved in&nbsp;her daughter Olympia’s life. Her dedication is&nbsp;such that in&nbsp;5&nbsp;years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from her. Despite being a&nbsp;highly accomplished athlete, Williams <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> that nothing feels like a&nbsp;sacrifice when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;her daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCmvsSnmGavmaG5qq3MrGSsoJGnsrR506GcZqCRp8CpedGemKWhpJ6ytHnOn2Smp6SdsrO0zqibZp2mmrtutMSrZKedkad6pbHArZ9mnailsrO1xKeanmVoZoN5gpVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
