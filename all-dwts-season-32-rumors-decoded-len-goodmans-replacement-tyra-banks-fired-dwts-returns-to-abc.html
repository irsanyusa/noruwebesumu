These rumors include Len Goodman’s replacement, Tyra Banks leaving the show, and DWTS‘s decision to stay on Disney+. Buckle up for this whirlwind of rumored changes.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-len-goodman-s-potential-replacement-in-dwts-revealed>Len Goodman’s Potential Replacement in DWTS Revealed</h2><p>One episode away from DWTS season 31 finale, head judge Len Goodman shocked everybody by announcing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his retirement</a>. According to him, he wants to spend more time with his family, thus the need to go back to his home country, United Kingdom.</p><p>Today, DWTS is trying to find someone that would complete the panel of judges for the next season. While nothing is sure yet, an unknown source claimed that the show is considering Strictly Come Dancing judge Motsi Mabuse to fill Goodman’s empty seat.</p><p>“Motsi is a very outspoken and lively character,” the insider said. “She is loved on the UK version for being a strong independent mind and someone who stands up for herself.”</p><p>Mabuse is a fan-favorite judge in the British competition show and is reportedly on top of the list to replace Goodman on DWTS. The insider mentioned that Mabuse “would bring a new perspective to the show, and much-needed diversity to the table.”</p><p>Strictly judge <a href=#>Shirley Ballas</a> is also said to be one the best options. Meanwhile, there were also DWTS pros who expressed their desire to be in the panel such as Cheryl Burke and Gleb Savchenko.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tyra Banks Might Not Host Next Season</h2><p>Aside from a change in the judging panel, DWTS is also allegedly considering a new host. If true, fans may not see resident host Tyra Banks in the next season. As stated by the insider, DWTS is unhappy with Banks for not promoting the show as much as expected.</p><p>“It is upsetting. If she did not have her executive producer role, some of us believe she would have already departed,” the insider told <a href=#>The Sun</a>.</p><p>Long before this claim, some DWTS fans were already urging the show to remove Banks as host. Throughout the previous seasons, Banks has received consecutive online backlash due to her chaotic hosting style. Her over the top outfits, live blunders, and insensitive remarks have been called out by fans multiple times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will DWTS Switch Back to ABC?</h2><p>Another source revealed that DWTS will possibly stream on ABC again. Apparently, the show strongly felt that fans would still want the show to be more accessible.</p><p>“At first, the Disney+ move was a success and everyone was happy, but no one talked about real ratings or how well the show was doing,” the source said. “Truthfully, there was a fear among some of the team that ABC viewers didn’t come across.”</p><p>Just this year, DWTS made the decision to air the competition from ABC to Disney+. While several viewers did not let go of the show and availed a Disney+ subscription, many have also expressed their frustration over the sudden switch of network.</p><p>Amid ongoing DWTS rumors, we’re yet to know whether these probable changes will ring true. &nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-Voice-Kim-Cruse-220x147.png alt="‘The Voice’ Recap: Top 8 Pull Out All the Stops in the Semifinals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKWjZpynqcBuv8SaqqimXWh%2Fbr7Upqarq12ZsqS7w56bZqSVo3qou86dpJqmo2K%2FprzLmpqepZWjwW7A2KuYZpqRo7i0ecWiqZ6cXZnEtb%2BMq5ytraKjwG7AzmaYm5tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
