The <a href=# title=sun data-link=tag>sun</a> is&nbsp;shining, and you enjoy the <a href=# title=weather data-link=tag>weather</a> and life on&nbsp;the whole. That’s when you spot a&nbsp;rapidly growing vertical cloud.</p><p>Bright white at&nbsp;first, it’s approaching alarmingly fast, becoming dense and inky. The <a href=# title=sky data-link=tag>sky</a> is&nbsp;darkening, and a&nbsp;gust of&nbsp;wind blows the hat off your head.</p><p>And then, your hair starts to&nbsp;stand on&nbsp;end!<strong> </strong>That’s your cue to&nbsp;run for your life&nbsp;— you’re about to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hit by&nbsp;lightning! At&nbsp;this very moment, positive charges are rising through your body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/eac/e1a/2776955bbfae72a506efe3ce83.png><p>They’re reaching toward the negatively charged part of&nbsp;the storm. If&nbsp;you don’t react fast, these charges will meet, and it’ll end badly for you.</p><p>If&nbsp;there’s nowhere you can hide, crouch down and try to&nbsp;make yourself smaller than the objects around you. Don’t lie flat on&nbsp;the ground&nbsp;— it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;wet and, thus, a&nbsp;great conductor of&nbsp;electricity.</p><p>There are also other signs that scream danger during a&nbsp;lightning storm. Your palms may begin to&nbsp;sweat. You might hear bizarre crackling, buzzing, or&nbsp;vibrating sounds coming from metal objects nearby.</p><p>Your <a href=# title=skin data-link=tag>skin</a> can start to&nbsp;tingle. There might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange metallic taste in&nbsp;your mouth. If&nbsp;you’re sure you’re not chewing on&nbsp;tin foil, then look out!</p><p>Plus, you’re likely to&nbsp;smell chlorine. That’s ozone. Electrical charges split the molecules of&nbsp;nitrogen and oxygen (which are the main gases forming the atmosphere) into separate atoms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f42/a6b/0d38cc5e3f81d2946f753c357d.png><p>When these atoms come together again, some of&nbsp;them produce molecules made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;three oxygen atoms&nbsp;— that’s ozone. You can smell it&nbsp;during a&nbsp;thunderstorm because downdrafts bring it&nbsp;from high altitudes to&nbsp;your nose level.</p><p>You can figure out how close a&nbsp;thunderstorm is&nbsp;by&nbsp;measuring the time between spotting the lightning and hearing the thunder. Every five seconds is&nbsp;one mile [1.0&nbsp;mi 1.6&nbsp;km].</p><p>The sky over your head is&nbsp;darkening and turning ominously green. Something hits you on&nbsp;the cheek&nbsp;— ouch! It&nbsp;hurts! You pick up&nbsp;the offending object&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;massive hailstone! But it’s not that cold outside, and it’s not raining...</p><p>You notice how still everything&nbsp;is, how quiet. There’s no&nbsp;wind whatsoever. It&nbsp;makes you think about the calm before the storm.</p><p>And indeed, soon you hear some <a href=# title=noise data-link=tag>noise</a>. It’s approaching rapidly and turns into a&nbsp;loud roar&nbsp;— as&nbsp;if&nbsp;a&nbsp;freight train is&nbsp;moving toward you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b35/3cb/327c1f5ceebac2984bea9ea978.jpg><p>Only it’s not a&nbsp;train. It’s a&nbsp;tornado, and you have almost no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;escape! The funnel isn’t visible behind a&nbsp;cloud of&nbsp;debris. But you can’t mistake this rotating column of&nbsp;air for anything else.</p><p>If&nbsp;the tornado catches you on&nbsp;the road, get as&nbsp;far from your <a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a> as&nbsp;you can. This will prevent the vehicle from being hurtled toward you. Find a&nbsp;ditch, lie down in&nbsp;it, and cover your head.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re inside, get away from windows and hide underground if&nbsp;possible. Now, you’re at&nbsp;the seaside, walking along the shore and enjoying a&nbsp;light breeze. Suddenly, the ground starts shaking under your feet! Must be&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=# title=earthquake data-link=tag>earthquake</a>!</p><p>The next weirdness you notice is&nbsp;the water retreating from the <a href=# title=beach data-link=tag>beach</a> at&nbsp;breakneck speed. It&nbsp;leaves behind the exposed ocean floor, reefs, and even <a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a>!</p><p>That’s when you hear a&nbsp;distant roaring sound. It’s a&nbsp;tsunami! And you only have a&nbsp;few minutes to&nbsp;save your life! Get to&nbsp;high ground immediately&nbsp;— a&nbsp;giant wave is&nbsp;already speeding toward the shore!</p><p>It’s not the only way a&nbsp;tsunami can creep up&nbsp;on&nbsp;you. It&nbsp;doesn’t necessarily come crashing against the shore as&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;huge waves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/af9/888/12d2845b799eeb15437bb299a1.png><p>A&nbsp;tsunami can look like a&nbsp;rapidly rising tide. It&nbsp;usually goes hand in&nbsp;hand with severe underwater turbulence. It&nbsp;pulls people under the surface and tosses heavy objects around.</p><p>You can also notice seawater bubbling, swirling, and creating bizarre patterns. It’s another sure sign a&nbsp;tsunami’s coming! Your dog’s restless. It’s scratching the entrance door, roaming around the apartment, and trying to&nbsp;hide in&nbsp;the corner. Usually calm and docile, the pooch is&nbsp;now howling and barking.</p><p>The weather’s also been crazy for the past several days. It’s hot one day and chilly 24&nbsp;hours later. Plus, you’ve noticed that the stream near your house has livened&nbsp;up, bubbling as&nbsp;it’s rushing past. Only when glasses start to&nbsp;clink in&nbsp;your cupboard do&nbsp;you realize what it&nbsp;means. The clatter is&nbsp;produced by&nbsp;foreshocks&nbsp;— tiny earthquakes leading up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the “main event.”</p><p>Earthquakes often occur in&nbsp;clusters. If&nbsp;there are several weak quakes, a&nbsp;much bigger one might be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the way. Some time before the disaster strikes, you might notice bizarre blue lights. Some of&nbsp;them seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;coming from the ground, others are hovering in&nbsp;the air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/828/d2d/54ab545818bd2e0472e91cc6ce.png><p>These are so-called “earthquake lights.” Emitted from rocks under great stress, they can be&nbsp;seen days or&nbsp;mere seconds before the ground starts shaking. At&nbsp;the same time, some experts doubt earthquake lights exist.</p><p>If&nbsp;you think an&nbsp;earthquake is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;happen and there’s a&nbsp;catfish in&nbsp;your aquarium, pay attention to&nbsp;its behavior. Scientists have proved this species can react to&nbsp;earth tremors. The fish become restless when seismic activity is&nbsp;high.</p><p>Some bugs can feel a&nbsp;storm coming. They get ready for the natural disaster by&nbsp;stopping any movement. That’s why if&nbsp;you notice that lots of&nbsp;insects around you look drowsy, search for shelter.</p><p>As&nbsp;for bees, they can predict heavy rainstorms. They begin to&nbsp;work much harder the day before it&nbsp;starts raining. Square waves occur when two different wave patterns crash into each other. This phenomenon looks awesome&nbsp;— but only if&nbsp;you’re watching it&nbsp;from the shore. Don’t even think of&nbsp;getting in&nbsp;the water to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;such waves. In&nbsp;that place, there are cross-currents that can easily pull even a&nbsp;skilled swimmer under the surface.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/247/d0a/2aa97e5ecf9e7bccd8a9cf55a2.png><p>And if&nbsp;you see wild, choppy waves carrying ocean debris and seaweed, stay out of&nbsp;the water too. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong rip current. It&nbsp;can carry you far away from the ocean.</p><p>If&nbsp;you see smelly green stuff on&nbsp;the surface of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lake or&nbsp;sea, stay away from the water. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hazardous algal bloom. You won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;tell whether it’s toxic or&nbsp;not at&nbsp;first sight. That’s why it’s better to&nbsp;steer clear of&nbsp;it&nbsp;altogether.</p><p>Three to&nbsp;four [3&nbsp;to&nbsp;4] days before a&nbsp;hurricane arrives, the sea or&nbsp;ocean surface can swell up&nbsp;to&nbsp;6&nbsp;ft [2&nbsp;m]. Waves hit the shore every 9&nbsp;seconds. The closer the hurricane, the more rapidly the waves crash against the shore. They also get higher&nbsp;— sometimes up&nbsp;to&nbsp;16&nbsp;ft [5&nbsp;m]! The sky is&nbsp;littered with light, fluffy clouds. Roughly 36&nbsp;hours before the hurricane reaches the shore, the atmospheric pressure begins to&nbsp;drop.</p><p>After that, the wind speeds&nbsp;up. Wispy, hair-like clouds appear in&nbsp;the sky. Eighteen hours before the hurricane makes it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the shore, the sky opens&nbsp;up, and it&nbsp;starts to&nbsp;pour. The rainwater often floods low-lying areas, welling up&nbsp;to&nbsp;15&nbsp;ft [4.5&nbsp;m].</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0c6/6bb/ec388f5adc907da149ad4902cb.png><p>When the hurricane is&nbsp;12&nbsp;hours away, a&nbsp;powerful gale starts to&nbsp;bring along loose debris. Six hours before the landfall, the wind speed is&nbsp;already 90&nbsp;mph [145&nbsp;kph]. It’s strong enough to&nbsp;break and even uproot trees, fling around large debris, and flip cars.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, let’s say you’re sailing, and there are some sharks circling your boat. Keep an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;them. If&nbsp;the predators suddenly leave you alone and head for deep water, it&nbsp;might mean a&nbsp;hurricane is&nbsp;drawing closer. Get back to&nbsp;dry land as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;you can and warn others.</p><p>If&nbsp;during a&nbsp;period of&nbsp;heavy rains you hear a&nbsp;roaring sound, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;flash flood moving in&nbsp;your direction. If&nbsp;you’re near a&nbsp;river at&nbsp;that moment, you might see debris coming down with the flow. The water can be&nbsp;changing its color and becoming cloudier and darker.</p><p>These signs should set alarm bells ringing in&nbsp;your head. If&nbsp;your gut feeling is&nbsp;right, you have no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;waste. Try to&nbsp;get away from that place as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;you can&nbsp;— flash floods are often lethal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/eb7/734/505d225fa389aad9d4ffd43605.png><p>If&nbsp;you’re out in&nbsp;the wild, pay attention to&nbsp;the water in&nbsp;creeks, streams, and rivers. If&nbsp;it’s falling or&nbsp;rising rapidly, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign a&nbsp;landslide is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;happen.</p><p>And if&nbsp;you see the water turn muddy, don’t wait for more evidence. Get out of&nbsp;the area immediately.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorKtlmJa2s3nSrZinnKNivK95xKebZrGfqsOmedKemqimlKh6tbuMq6ynZWhmgXWAkmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
