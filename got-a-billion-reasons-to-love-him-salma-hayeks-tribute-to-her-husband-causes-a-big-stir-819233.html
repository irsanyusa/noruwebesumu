Despite addressing these rumors, the same hurtful comments still flood her Instagram posts whenever she celebrates her husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bae/677/fde60550ffa25157a9b4d824a0.jpg><p>More than a&nbsp;decade into her marriage, the actress still remembers the stereotypical accusations she faced after marrying billionaire businessman François-Henri Pinault. The couple met in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2006</a>, not realizing their casual conversation would blossom into something serious. Salma and François-Henri have a&nbsp;daughter together, and Salma is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;stepmom to&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>three</a> kids from a&nbsp;previous relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/72e/d6e/7b2a5b5d3b94c8759228e2348c.jpg><p>The Oscar-nominated star has often addressed the misconceptions around her marriage, saying that when she married him, everyone thought it&nbsp;was for the money. Gushing over her husband, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Fifteen years together, and we&nbsp;are strong in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. I&nbsp;don’t even get offended; I’m like, yeah, whatever.” She also mentioned that there’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;unfair judgment against wealthy men, with people assuming that being rich means they might not be&nbsp;good people.</p><p>Despite repeatedly addressing the issue, whenever Salma shares moments with her husband, the same accusations of&nbsp;marrying for money resurface. Yet, Salma recently took to&nbsp;Instagram to&nbsp;express her love for François-Henri, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posting</a> a&nbsp;captivating carousel of&nbsp;images capturing their intimate moments, including those where they share tender gazes and affectionate gestures on&nbsp;the red carpet.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;moving tribute for her husband’s birthday, Salma poured out her heart: “God bless the day you were born, mi&nbsp;amor. Thank you for the endless love and laughter you bring me&nbsp;each day. Happy birthday, my&nbsp;king.” This declaration of&nbsp;love resonated deeply, stirring admiration for their profound connection and leaving a&nbsp;lasting impression on&nbsp;all who saw the post on&nbsp;Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e76/684/42686c5f1ea8f67ef4851f6a88.jpg><p>Underneath the carousel of&nbsp;pictures, a&nbsp;commenter playfully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarked</a>: “Got a&nbsp;billion reasons to&nbsp;love him,” cleverly playing with words to&nbsp;suggest Salma’s affection stems from his wealth. Another commenter added a&nbsp;touch of&nbsp;irony, saying, “Money can’t buy hap... wait. It&nbsp;can.” Meanwhile, another person commented, “This is&nbsp;what you can get when you have a&nbsp;LOT of&nbsp;money... 🤷🏽‍♂️”</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the remarks about wealth, some comments focused on&nbsp;the age gap, with one person stating, “She’s beautiful. He’s old,” while another sarcastically remarked, “Your Dad looks like a&nbsp;great guy ❤️,” and others simply referred to&nbsp;Pinault as&nbsp;“Old man.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c2/502/206b685b23a24c8b6c32639d7b.jpg><p>Love triumphed over the critics, and the post was flooded with comments defending Salma. Many noted that the 4-year age gap wasn’t significant, with one person saying, “People thinking there’s a&nbsp;big age gap, they’re 4&nbsp;years apart, people calm down.”</p><p>Others expressed support for the couple, like one user who wrote, “The way you look at&nbsp;him 😊 with so&nbsp;much love 🥰,” and another who commented, “The secret of&nbsp;eternal youth is&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful love that makes you smile every day ❤️.”</p><p>And in&nbsp;response to&nbsp;allegations that she married for money, one commenter shut down the <a href=# title=criticism data-link=tag>criticism</a>, saying, “She loves him. She still works and always has. She didn’t marry a&nbsp;wealthy man to&nbsp;retire. She met a&nbsp;man who made her laugh and shared the same ambition and mentality. Bravo.” This comment effectively silenced all the critics.</p><p>Recently, people criticized Salma over speculation about her supposed <a href=#>plastic surgery</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLSwwIyaZJuhnKG2sLqMq5yaq5%2BjwG7AzmajqK6VYrWquYysmKWlkWK1osXEpKpmrKKer7bAxGarqGWYmr9utNSsmZqmlGKwosHSnqpmmV2Xtqh50q2gq2VoZoZzf5Jo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
