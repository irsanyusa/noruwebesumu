Since ​​Switzerland first celebrated Mother’s Day in 1917, the holiday has grown into a time-honored tradition meant to show appreciation for the love and care mothers give to their families.</p><p>Today, Mother’s Day is widely celebrated across the country with the presentation of gifts and flowers, family outings, and acts of appreciation for the institution of motherhood. Let’s learn when and how Swiss Mother’s Day is celebrated and how to wish mothers a happy Mother’s Day in Switzerland.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-history-of-Mother’s-Day-in-Switzerland>The history of Mother’s Day in Switzerland</h2><p>Mother’s Day was first established in Switzerland in 1917, by the Salvation Army. The celebration was restricted to small circles until the 1920s, when florists, pastry chefs and other interested parties began to get involved.&nbsp;</p><p>The breakthrough came in 1930, when the day was promoted in the press and on the radio. Flyers hung throughout cities and displays in shop windows helped to further spread the word that a special new holiday had arrived in Switzerland.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-is-Mother’s-Day-in-Switzerland?>When is Mother’s Day in Switzerland?</h2><p>In Switzerland, Mother’s Day is observed on the second Sunday of May, so the exact date varies from year to year.&nbsp;</p><p>Switzerland is one of the many countries around the world that celebrate Mother’s Day on this date. The tradition was established in the United States in the early 20th century. It spread widely in the subsequent decades, and the second Sunday in May is now the most common date to celebrate Mother’s Day.&nbsp;</p><p>Other countries celebrate the holiday on different dates. For example, Switzerland’s neighbor, France, celebrates Mother’s Day on the last Sunday of May. In general, Mother’s Day is on Sunday in most countries, as this gives families the opportunity to have time to be together.</p><p>Mother’s Day in Switzerland may be moved if it overlaps with Pentecost, though this has not been the case in recent years.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-is-Swiss-Mother’s-Day-celebrated?>How is Swiss Mother’s Day celebrated?</h2><p>There may be variations in the customs associated with Mother’s Day celebrations in different countries and cultures. In Switzerland, Mother’s Day is not a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">public holiday</a>, so it would be unusual to make a whole day’s celebration out of it. Nevertheless, it is a great opportunity to bring the family together.</p><p>On Mother’s Day, people in Switzerland often express their gratitude and affection to their mothers and carers by giving gifts, sending cards and spending quality time with their loved ones. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">School children</a> often make and paint gifts at school to bring home to their mothers. Many families also enjoy special meals or outings together to celebrate the occasion. Mothers may get breakfast in bed, and they are generally not expected to cook dinner on their special day.</p><p>People often give gifts to their mothers as a token of appreciation. Popular gifts include flowers, chocolates, perfumes, jewelry and personalized items. Of course, many people take the opportunity to express their feelings by writing a heartfelt card.</p><p>The most important thing for many mothers is that they spend the day with their family. Many plan an outing, such as a hike in the beautiful <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swiss mountains</a> or a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lakeside</a> picnic. A wellness day is another popular option. Children who are old enough might make their mother a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">traditional meal</a> to celebrate, or the family might go out for dinner at a favorite restaurant.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Saying-“Happy-Mother’s-Day”-in-Switzerland>Saying “Happy Mother’s Day” in Switzerland</h2><p>Switzerland is a multilingual country with four official languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Therefore, the Mothers’ Day greeting will depend on which canton you are in:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>German</strong></a>: “Alles Gute zum Muttertag” or “Einen schönen Muttertag”&nbsp;</li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>French</strong></a>: “Bonne fête des mères”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Italian</strong>: “Buona festa della mamma”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Romansh</strong>: “Buna di festa dallas mamas”&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Happy Mums all around</h2><p>After one hundred years, Mother’s Day has certainly found its place in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swiss tradition</a>. It is wonderful to see the Swiss demonstrate their appreciation of mothers on Mother’s Day — a sign of the high esteem in which mothers in Swiss society are held. Mothers everywhere push themselves to the limits to make the best life possible for their families, relatives, friends and neighbors. This applies, in equal measure, to Swiss Mums.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Leona-e1679309439969.jpeg><h2>Leona Quigley</h2><p>Leona has her roots in the South of Ireland, where she grew up on her family farm.
