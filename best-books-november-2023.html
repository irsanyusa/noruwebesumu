Beginning with the end of civilization and jumping back and forth through time, Naomi Alderman, the award-winning author of 2016's The Power, weaves a cautionary tale of what society stands to lose in a near-future where AI has transformed all walks of life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: The Future on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Vulnerables, Sigrid Nunez (Nov. 7)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/TheVulnerables.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Set against the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, National Book Award winner Sigrid Nunez's tender and humorous new novel explores the abiding power of connection during an era of unprecedented isolation. The Vulnerables centers on an aging, solitary female writer (the story's narrator) who moves into a friend of a friend's Manhattan apartment. There, she cares for a pet macaw named Eureka while its owner is stuck in California. When the bird's previous sitter, a collegiate Gen Z-er, unexpectedly shows up at the apartment after getting kicked out of his parents' house, the trio form an unexpected bond that carries them through a time of widespread fear and uncertainty.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: The Vulnerables on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Same Bed Different Dreams, Ed Park (Nov. 7)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SameBedDifferentDreams.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">From the acclaimed author of the 2008 novel Personal Days comes a sprawling work of meta speculative fiction. In Same Bed Different Dreams, Ed Park imagines an alternate history in which the Korean Provisional Government established during Japanese occupation secretly persisted beyond the end of Japanese rule in 1945 and into today. Through<strong> </strong>riveting prose, Park describes how its members work behind the scenes to unite a fractured Korea. In doing so,<strong> </strong>the author weaves together three intersecting narratives to create a poignant, postmodern epic that turns 20th century history on its head.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: Same Bed Different Dreams on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">To Free the Captives: A Plea for the American Soul, Tracy K.

Smith delivers a searing manifesto on the power of collective ritual in confronting the persistence of violence and racism against Black people in America. A Pulitzer Prize winner, Smith combines lyrical reflections on her personal experiences as a Black woman, mother, and educator with a historical examination of how her ancestors endured in the face of overwhelming oppression and subjugation. In writing a book about "Black strength, Black continuance, and the powerful forms of belief and community that have long bolstered the soul of my people," <a href=#>Smith says</a> she came to believe that "all of us, in the here and now, can choose to work alongside the generations that precede us in tending to America’s oldest wounds and meeting the urgencies of our present.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: To Free the Captives on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">My Name is Barbra, Barbra Streisand (Nov. 7)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MyNameIsBarbra.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Over the course of nearly 1,000 pages, living legend Barbra Streisand tells the story of her life and decades-spanning career as one of the most iconic figures of the stage and screen.

Weary of campus racism at the Boston liberal arts college where they both teach, the duo leaves the city in pursuit of a new dream. With the help of a wealthy benefactor, the couple begin constructing an underground world<strong> </strong>with the aim of creating a utopia<strong> </strong>where people can feel accepted and protected. Dubbed the New Naturals, the sanctuary is located under an abandoned restaurant on a hill off a highway in Western Massachusetts. But as their subterranean haven grows—and begins to attract a motley crew of guests, from a dejected former college soccer star to two unhoused men who travel from Chicago by bus to reach the facility—questions of what really makes for a true safe space for all threaten to derail the burgeoning experiment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: The New Naturals on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Day, Michael Cunningham (Nov. 14)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Day.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Michael Cunningham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Hours, delivers a quietly profound portrait of a Brooklyn family navigating love and loss before, during, and after COVID-19 upends their existence. Day, Cunningham's first book in nearly a decade, is divided into three sections, each set during a snapshot of time on a single day over three successive years—“April 5, 2019: Morning,” “April 5, 2020: Afternoon,” and “April 5, 2021: Evening”—and handles recent history with care and nuance. Although the words COVID and pandemic never appear in the novel, Cunningham told the <a href=#>New York Times</a> that he felt compelled to center the story around the outbreak of the virus. “How does anybody,” he said, “write a contemporary novel that’s about human beings that’s not about the pandemic?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: Day on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Critical Hits: Writers Playing Video Games, edited by J.
