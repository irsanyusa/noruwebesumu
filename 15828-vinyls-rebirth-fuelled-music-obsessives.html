Tesco now sells vinyl albums in its stores, and has even adapted some of its advertising to tie its 'back to basics' range to <a href=#>with iconic album covers</a>. While Urban Outfitters is another outlet with a significant vinyl section, it is still relatively rare for major high street chains to stock records in a bid to lure younger consumers.</p><p>But who are the people fuelling vinyl's comeback?</p><p>YouGov Profiles data suggests that records' resurgence is rooted in middle-aged nostalgia. When compared to the adult population as a whole, those that have purchased a vinyl album recently are more likely to be aged between 45-54. By contrast, those in the 18-24 aged group are the least likely.</p><p>Furthermore, music plays a central part in vinyl buyer’s lives. Two thirds (66%) of this group say they could not get through day without listening to music, compared to 49% of UK adults in general. A third (33%) of record buyers say they listen 'whenever they can' compared to 25% of over-18s overall.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/vinyl.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Record buyers are passionate about music and are more likely to go to gigs than the population at large. Fully two-thirds (68%) of vinyl lovers say they enjoy seeing their favourite artists live (compared to 47%) and are more likely to be happy to spend money to support their preferred acts (21% compared to 9%). Downloading music illegally is condemned, with 59% of vinyl fans saying it is wrong, compared to 55% of over-18s in general.</p><p>There may be a suggestion that music helps this group emotionally too. Vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to both keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).</p><p>For now, the vinyl renaissance remains something of a sideshow to the digital juggernaut. To become fully ingratiated in music culture once more, vinyl will have to covince younger music fans – used to the convenience their preferred services provide – of their worth. Doing this will be no easy thing given playing a record requires them to buy a load of new (and expensive) kit.</p><p>What’s more, those in the younger age groups must be convinced to see the albums as more than just an extension to their favourite band's t-shirt. It will be a irony indeed if album covers are used to sell everything except the records themselves.</p><p>Image PA</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWqFc4SMr6CnsZyoerOxwaKpraBdm8KmuMuem2alpai2pHnOm6qeq6Oew6a%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
