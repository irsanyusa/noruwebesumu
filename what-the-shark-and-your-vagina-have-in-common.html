It's found in high concentrations in the livers of sharks, but it's also present in smaller amounts in other animals, including humans. It's a key component of human sebum, an oily substance produced by our skin glands. But here's the interesting part: squalene plays a role in vaginal lubrication, a vital aspect of women's reproductive health.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>Squalene and your vagina</h3></p><p>Now, let's shift gears and talk about your vagina. Squalene is a component of healthy vaginal lubrication. The walls of your vagina contain glands that produce a lubricating fluid. This fluid helps with sexual intercourse, reducing friction and discomfort. Squalene is one of the key ingredients in this lubrication, along with other substances like water and mucus.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-f6d0c0f6-4322-407b-b251-3fae08816a0e data-caption="The squalene and your vagina [sofeminine]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/rnMktkpTURBXy8xOTQxN2Y5MDY4NzBlZTQwNWExNzg2NzNiMzRmYWYxYi5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAZ_Cww></span><p>Absolutely not! Squalene is just one component of vaginal lubrication, and it doesn't have a strong odour. The unique scent of your vagina is influenced by a combination of factors like hormones, bacteria, and diet.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>Why squalene matters</h3></p><p>The presence of squalene in vaginal lubrication is vital for a healthy sex life.

However, due to concerns about overfishing, plant-based squalene is becoming increasingly popular.</li><li>Squalene is also found in some deep-sea fish and even in some plants like olives and amaranth.</li><li>Squalene has various industrial uses, including in cosmetics, dietary supplements, and even as an adjuvant (a substance that helps vaccines work more effectively).</li></ul><p>The shared presence of squalene in sharks and human vaginas is a quirky fact that showcases the wonders of nature.
