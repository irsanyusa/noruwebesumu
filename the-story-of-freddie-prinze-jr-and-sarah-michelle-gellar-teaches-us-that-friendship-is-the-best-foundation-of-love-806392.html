A&nbsp;couple that has managed to&nbsp;keep their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> alive for years is&nbsp;always a&nbsp;cause for celebration. One such very-much-in-love celebrity couple is&nbsp;Freddie Prinze Jr., <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>46</a>, and Sarah Michelle Gellar, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>44</a>. But what’s even cooler is&nbsp;how their love started as&nbsp;nothing more than <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a>.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> looked into Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.’s relationship timeline. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful story with its seeds sown in&nbsp;on-set camaraderie with a&nbsp;touch of&nbsp;serendipity.</p><p><h2>1. It&nbsp;all began as&nbsp;simple work bonhomie and friendship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/436/741/9dd5f852df82b401af2ed5d8e8.jpg><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr. <strong>first connected on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;the 1997&nbsp;movie</strong>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>I&nbsp;Know What You Did Last Summer</i></a>. While the two did not have too many scenes together, the fact that Gellar did not drive or&nbsp;have a&nbsp;driver’s license led to&nbsp;enforced proximity.</p><p>Movie production took place in&nbsp;the coastal town of&nbsp;Southport, 48&nbsp;km from the nearest big city of&nbsp;Wilmington, so&nbsp;<strong>Prinze&nbsp;Jr. started to&nbsp;drive her</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a3/dda/d3774c5bf68f8d12a7bba3bb8d.jpg><p>He&nbsp;said so&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, “It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;hour’s drive just to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the gym. And when we&nbsp;transported the film down to&nbsp;South Park, she had no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;there. So, <strong>I&nbsp;started driving her, and that’s when she and&nbsp;I became friends</strong>. And we&nbsp;just would talk about life and stuff like that, and <strong>we&nbsp;had completely different philosophies on&nbsp;just about everything</strong>. ‘Cause she was a&nbsp;born and raised New Yorker and&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;born and raised L.A. kid, and we&nbsp;just looked at&nbsp;everything like night and day.”</p><p>That was the beginning of&nbsp;the friendship, and later, the couple also starred in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Scooby-Doo</i></a> franchise, beginning in&nbsp;2002.</p><p><h2>2. Prinze&nbsp;Jr. wanted to&nbsp;cook for her because that’s what his family does.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95e/55f/c7c83457f39a5bc383ffc65f06.jpg><p>The couple bonded over road trips and <a href=# title=food data-link=tag>food</a> because Gellar was hired towards the end, right before production started. They were <strong>meeting for the first time</strong>, although she did know Ryan Phillippe from soaps before and might have also known Jennifer Love-Hewitt.</p><p>Gellar and Prinze&nbsp;Jr., gelled, but his initial reaction was that <strong>she was a&nbsp;bit too skinny, and he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;cook for her</strong> because that’s what his family did, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;general practice. The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “And&nbsp;so, we&nbsp;started this weekly barbecue thing at&nbsp;her house, and&nbsp;I and my&nbsp;cousins would come over and cook food for her and her friends. And then <strong>we’d make sure everybody ate, and that was kind of&nbsp;how our friendship began</strong>.”</p><p><h2>3. This is&nbsp;what blew Freddie away about Sarah.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/650/edb/b9eb2659258169504d7a288b02.jpg><p>Three years later, Gellar and Prinze&nbsp;Jr. still met for that odd lunch date, and in&nbsp;January 2000, the two decided to&nbsp;get together again, with a&nbsp;mutual friend. As&nbsp;luck would have&nbsp;it, <strong>the friend missed her flight, but the couple decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;ahead with their plans in&nbsp;any case</strong>.</p><p>Gellar even wrote so&nbsp;on&nbsp;her Instagram, saying, “20&nbsp;years ago this week, my&nbsp;friend [Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr.] and&nbsp;I were supposed to&nbsp;have dinner with a&nbsp;mutual friend from out of&nbsp;town. That friend missed her flight, but we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;still meet and catch&nbsp;up.” She continued writing, “Now <strong>20&nbsp;years together, 17&nbsp;plus married and two kids, we&nbsp;still go&nbsp;to&nbsp;that restaurant for dinner</strong>. So&nbsp;thank you [Leslie] for not showing up&nbsp;for dinner.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/136/000/d2e1265e03a814d9d283d03755.jpg><p>But there was something about <strong>that first “date” that blew Prinze away</strong>. According to&nbsp;the happily married couple, Freddie took her to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rather upscale <a href=# title=sushi data-link=tag>sushi</a> eatery, his favorite, Asanebo in&nbsp;LA, and during the meal came to&nbsp;realize that she was nothing like the other girls he&nbsp;had met.</p><p>Prinze <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> so&nbsp;as&nbsp;well, “A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;girls back then in&nbsp;Hollywood—as far as&nbsp;the actresses—they didn’t eat. They ate salad. <strong>Sarah came to&nbsp;dinner with&nbsp;me</strong>, and we&nbsp;sat down. <strong>She ate everything</strong>, including a&nbsp;crab that they let walk across the counter, [later cooked&nbsp;in] oil and said, ’It’s popcorn, try.’” When she did this, Prinze remembers, “I&nbsp;was like, ’yo, <strong>my&nbsp;girl is&nbsp;legit</strong>.’”</p><p><h2>4. From dating to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/938/4e4/da717e5e9db15a3ed1fa2477e3.jpg><p>Gellar recalls it&nbsp;a&nbsp;little differently, as&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “We&nbsp;were friends for a&nbsp;very long time. We’ve had many dinners before. [After our friend didn’t show&nbsp;up] we&nbsp;were just two people at&nbsp;dinner catching&nbsp;up. <strong>We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;long car ride and a&nbsp;long dinner, and things just happened</strong>.” At&nbsp;the time, they didn’t “believe” in&nbsp;marriage, but Prinze&nbsp;Jr. knew he&nbsp;did not want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with anyone else following that one date.</p><p>He&nbsp;said, “<strong>I&nbsp;didn’t go&nbsp;on&nbsp;dates with other girls</strong>, nor did&nbsp;I even want to&nbsp;pursue dates with other girls. One day, I&nbsp;just knew we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;get married and that<strong>&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;propose</strong>. I&nbsp;didn’t know when or&nbsp;how. Fortunately, she was on&nbsp;the same page and my&nbsp;instincts were correct. <strong>We’re together because we&nbsp;like each other</strong>. We&nbsp;make each other laugh.”</p><p>After dating in&nbsp;2000, the couple got engaged in&nbsp;2001 and finally tied the knot on&nbsp;September&nbsp;1, 2002, in&nbsp;Mexico.</p><p><h2>5. Making their children a&nbsp;priority</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a5/04c/6a1bed5d23885ea47de993b4cd.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2007, to&nbsp;celebrate the fifth year of&nbsp;marriage, Gellar <strong>legally changed her name to&nbsp;Sarah Michelle Prinze</strong>. In&nbsp;2009, they had their first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>child</a>, their daughter Charlotte Grace Prinze, and then a&nbsp;son, Rocky James Prinze, born in&nbsp;2012.</p><p>Things changed for the couple, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good way. Prinze lost his dad when he&nbsp;was just 10&nbsp;months old, so&nbsp;for him,<strong> being a&nbsp;father was a&nbsp;top priority</strong>. He&nbsp;said, “When my&nbsp;daughter was born, that was pretty much it&nbsp;for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;became a&nbsp;full-time father. <strong>It’s not a&nbsp;job. It’s what&nbsp;I love to&nbsp;do</strong>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ac/d74/df142459cd9cfe5b2d5fac8fda.jpg><p>Once they had their children, <strong>the couple became a&nbsp;bit picky about the next projects</strong> they wanted to&nbsp;do. Gellar was also raised by&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother and wanted her home to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. In&nbsp;2012, Gellar <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a>, “<strong>We&nbsp;fight over who gets to&nbsp;stay home</strong>. You’d think it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the opposite, that the parents would be&nbsp;like, ’No, I’ll go&nbsp;to&nbsp;work!’ but he’s like, ’You stayed home for two years! It’s my&nbsp;turn!’”</p><p>They are <strong>strict with their kids</strong>, with social media being a&nbsp;no-no and family dinners mean no&nbsp;phones. The mother of&nbsp;two <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that “Some people say our expectations are a&nbsp;little higher than most, but&nbsp;I think [our children] know what the rules are. We&nbsp;have [family dinner] as&nbsp;many nights as&nbsp;we&nbsp;can. We&nbsp;have no&nbsp;phones at&nbsp;the table. <strong>We&nbsp;sit, we&nbsp;all have dinner together.</strong>”</p><p><h2>6. How Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr. turned their marriage into a&nbsp;home.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/243/a6f/371bd15ddbbe756b233a451d69.jpg><p>The couple has made a&nbsp;successful marriage, balancing love, parenting, and work, and these are their tips.</p><p>Gellar took a&nbsp;page out of&nbsp;her husband’s book, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “You realize our society is&nbsp;such a&nbsp;technologically savvy and advanced community, but what are those moments where you connect? Where you put the phones down, and you have that one-on-one moment. I&nbsp;had this epiphany and&nbsp;I realized <strong>everything in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life was around food</strong>. Whether that’s having dinner at&nbsp;your home in&nbsp;the kitchen or&nbsp;you’re hanging out with friends, <strong>those are where the memories happen</strong>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ea/8f3/558a0659ee99ceac9fc7bada3d.jpg><p>And so, 22&nbsp;years later, after they first fell in&nbsp;love over food, <strong>the couple still cooks</strong>. Prinze Jr.’s love for food has now become a&nbsp;family passion, with Gellar and the children joining&nbsp;in.</p><p>Prinze <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claims</a>, “We&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;being a&nbsp;perfect balance. There was <strong>a&nbsp;solid foundation built, and that’s probably the main reason why we’ve always been cool and groovy</strong>.” Love, food, and knowing each other is&nbsp;the recipe behind their perfect marriage.</p><p>What is&nbsp;the one thing from Gellar and Prinze’s relationship that you feel is&nbsp;truly amazing?
