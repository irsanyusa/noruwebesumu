Here’s where the Mediterranean climate and Italian joie de vivre collide with the charm of Swiss villages. But it’s not only the weather and architecture that make the Swiss Italian regions special. The unique use of language in these parts of Switzerland sets it apart from other Italian-speaking regions.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Which-parts-of-Switzerland-are-considered-Italian?>Which parts of Switzerland are considered Italian?</h2><p>Switzerland is divided into 26 Kantone (cantons) and has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four official languages</a>: German, French, Italian and Romansh. While there are over 700,000 Swiss Italian speakers in the country, there’s only one canton in which Swiss Italian is the sole official language. This area of Switzerland is called Ticino or Tessin, and it’s located in the southernmost stretch of the country.&nbsp;</p><p>But Ticino isn’t the only place in Switzerland where you’ll hear Swiss Italian; the unique Italian dialect is also dominant in regions in the southern part of the canton of Graubünden, also known as Lombard Grisons or Grigioni. These regions are called Moesa, Bregaglia, Maloja and Bernina.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Are-there-differences-between-Swiss-Italian-and-Italian?>Are there differences between Swiss Italian and Italian?</h2><p>You may have noticed that we’re referring to the Italian spoken in Switzerland as “Swiss Italian” instead of simply “Italian.” This is intentional, as there are certain differences between Standard Italian and Swiss Italian that may cause confusion.</p><p>These differences tend to be of the vocalized variety, as Swiss Italian is one of the Italian dialects with no official written form. Schoolchildren in the Italian parts of Switzerland learn the standardized form of Italian, which is also used in an official capacity.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Vocabulary in Swiss Italian and Standard Italian</h3><p>The most significant differences between Swiss Italian and Standard Italian lie in their use of vocabulary. There are certain words in the Swiss Italian dialect that were borrowed from languages other than Italian, due to the constant exchange with cultures speaking French, German and Romansh.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Swiss Italian speakers use the word azione to refer to something being “on sale.” In Standard Italian, azione means “action,” while “on sale” would translate to offerta.&nbsp;</p><p>Many such examples exist, any of which is liable to cause a misunderstanding between Italian and Swiss Italian speakers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-to-see-in-the-Italian-part-of-Switzerland>What to see in the Italian part of Switzerland</h2><p>The Italian part of Switzerland is a popular tourist destination. On the one hand, this is due to the temperate Mediterranean climate in this part of Switzerland. But it also owes to a particularly interesting mix of cultures.</p><p>Picturesque Swiss Italian towns like Bellinzona or Lugano have a lot to offer in terms of scenery — both natural and man-made. With beautiful piazzas nestled between amazing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mountainous landscapes</a>, this mix is unlike anywhere else in the world. And nowhere is it on display more than in the city of Locarno, located at the Lago Maggiore. Locarno is surely one of the most beautiful Swiss Italian places, with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">castle</a> that dates back nearly 800 years.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ticino and South Grigioni: A unique cultural mix worth a visit</h2><p>Switzerland’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cantons</a>, with their incomparable history, have much to offer. The Italian part of Switzerland, located in the canton of Ticino and the Southern part of Grigioni, is an especially potent mix of landscapes and architecture. And it even comes with its own charming linguistic peculiarities.</p><p>If you’re planning on visiting the Italian part of Switzerland, beware that Swiss Italian differs from Standard Italian in some key ways — most of which you’ll hear in conversation rather than see written down. A quick language course with a local speaker can be helpful to avoid any potential misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lea-Hauke-Foto-1-1.jpg><h2>Lea Hauke</h2><p>Lea is a writer and translator for English and German and lives in Austria.
