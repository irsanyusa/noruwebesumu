He is expected to pay tribute to outgoing President<strong> Joe Biden</strong>, who served as Obama’s vice president for eight years.</p><p>He used his well-known rhetorical powers to deliver a thundering endorsement of the Democratic presidential nominee, <strong>Harris.</strong> Obama, who got his political start in Chicago, has kept a low profile since leaving office in January 2017.</p><p>But he remained a broadly popular public figure and one of the most powerful voices on the political left. Obama was first elected in 2008 and was the first black president in U.S. history.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Harris is the first female, first black and first Asian American U.S. vice president, she would be another White House trailblaser should she defeat Republican <strong>Donald Trump </strong>in November. No woman has ever been president.</p><p>Former first lady <strong>Michelle Obama </strong>is also set to deliver remarks on Tuesday night, as is Harris’ husband, second gentleman <strong>Doug Emhoff</strong>. Harris has wiped out Trump’s lead in national polls since Biden abandoned his campaign and endorsed Harris to succeed him a month ago.</p><p>Crucially, she has closed the gap or overtaken Trump in the key battleground states that will determine the outcome of the election. By the time the four-day convention would end next week, there would be just over 70 days to go until the election.</p><p>As the contest enters its last phases, the party hoped the bash would propel Harris into the autumn. She is due to take to the convention stage for a speech on Thursday night. write a news headline</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXywrsCmmGadnpm8s7%2FErGShmaKntrR5wKxknZ2dpLCzrdOimmabkaOxqrDArZxmr5mptW68zrCcq56loXqztMStpquhk2SCp8XDbqSq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
