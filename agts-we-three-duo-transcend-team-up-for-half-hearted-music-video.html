Let me be the first to tell you, it’s a breathtaking performance out of each group.</strong></p><p>It’s always great to see former AGT contestants teaming up years after they competed against each other in the show. It shows that even though someone was once considered your competitor you still have the opportunity for networking on the show.</p><p>After almost three years, the two groups have crossed paths and released an emotional collaboration. We Three’s song has extremely powerful lyrics, similar to the originals they sang on the AGT stage.</p><p>Since their first performance, it was obvious that they were a band that really put their heart and soul into the writing of their music. We Three auditioned with an original tribute song for their mother who died of cancer and they <a href=#>brought tears to the judges’ eyes</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>We Three chose the best aerialists to collaborate with for this video, considering their AGT act was known for being full of emotion. They chose to feature fellow AGT Season 13 alumni, <a href=#>Duo Transcend</a>, in their music video for Half Hearted.</p><p>The duo’s AGT audition act “wowed” the judges, but in a <a href=#>completely different way</a>. The judges commented heavily on how the married couple’s chemistry comes out in their trapeze act, and it seems like We Three remembered that comment.</p><p>The entire video features red mood lighting on both the band and the aerialists. The song talks about heartbreak and fighting in a relationship. The Duo Transcend makes this already intense song even more intense. Their emotion paired with We Three’s makes this video insanely powerful.</p><p>Duo Transcend’s trapeze art compliments the song perfectly and adds so much more feeling because of their chemistry. The emotions in this video are strong enough to bring someone to tears. It seriously shows both groups have so much talent.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234642211.jpeg alt="Jennifer Hudson Debuts Aretha Franklin Album as ‘Respect’ Hits Theaters" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrrGWnmnq1tNGenGacpaR6tb7Ap6qcnZ6ZerWxwKZkrqhdm7yzeceao59lmJqus8DEnWSmraOesG7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
