This is&nbsp;what happened to&nbsp;the woman who decided to&nbsp;share her story on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a>. She planned a&nbsp;trip with her husband and declined his mother‚Äôs insistence to&nbsp;join. However, at&nbsp;the airport, she discovered her husband had secretly booked his mother a&nbsp;ticket. Read the full story in&nbsp;our article.</p><p><h2>What actually happened?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95c/96e/15cd6f50f998c862c53cf6e908.jpg><p>I, a&nbsp;30-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>woman</a>, have a&nbsp;strained relationship with my&nbsp;husband‚Äôs mother. From the start, she‚Äôs made comparisons and critical remarks about&nbsp;me. Despite this, she later started to&nbsp;excessively praise me&nbsp;and even imitated me&nbsp;once by&nbsp;dyeing her hair purple like mine. When it&nbsp;backfired and people commented negatively, she blamed&nbsp;me.</p><p>Recently, my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I planned a&nbsp;two-week trip abroad. I&nbsp;organized and saved for&nbsp;it, while he&nbsp;handled ticket bookings. My&nbsp;husband‚Äôs mom wanted to&nbsp;come along and threw temper tantrums when&nbsp;I said&nbsp;no. She called, texted, sent people to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;me&nbsp;into letting her come, even threatened to&nbsp;call the police and make some complaint up&nbsp;to&nbsp;get&nbsp;us to&nbsp;stay if&nbsp;she can‚Äôt come.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband said we&nbsp;should just take her, but&nbsp;I told him he&nbsp;was wrong to&nbsp;tell her about the trip in&nbsp;the first place. He&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;an&nbsp;ultimatum. Said he&nbsp;wouldn‚Äôt go&nbsp;if&nbsp;she can‚Äôt come, and&nbsp;I told him I‚Äôd gladly call his bluff, which made him take his words back and say, ‚ÄúFINE! I&nbsp;will tell her to&nbsp;stop it&nbsp;because we&nbsp;won‚Äôt take her.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b85/4a0/5c715f5a7885bb93194643953e.jpg><p>Things got quieter, suspiciously quieter.</p><p>On&nbsp;the day of&nbsp;our trip, we&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>arrived</a> at&nbsp;the airport, and my&nbsp;husband seemed preoccupied, searching around as&nbsp;we&nbsp;walked. My&nbsp;husband was walking ahead of&nbsp;me&nbsp;and was looking left and right like he&nbsp;was looking for someone. I&nbsp;asked him, but he&nbsp;didn‚Äôt respond. He&nbsp;led me&nbsp;to&nbsp;the waiting area and the first thing&nbsp;I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage. I&nbsp;froze in&nbsp;my&nbsp;spot, I&nbsp;felt a&nbsp;cold wave washing over&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I was fuming inside.</p><p>She and my&nbsp;husband were hugging, that‚Äôs when&nbsp;I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My&nbsp;husband followed me&nbsp;while shouting at&nbsp;me&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop. He&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;stop&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I told him off the harshest way possible. He&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;say&nbsp;I was overreacting and that his mom was there ‚Äúanyway‚Äù and&nbsp;I should let it&nbsp;go&nbsp;and not mess the trip up&nbsp;for&nbsp;us. I&nbsp;told him he&nbsp;and his mom could still go&nbsp;and that&nbsp;I was going home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e36/171/4ede6d50b0a61664fb671f65ba.jpg><p>I&nbsp;went home and sobbed into my&nbsp;dog‚Äôs fur for several minutes. It&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>turned out</a> he&nbsp;booked her a&nbsp;ticket without me&nbsp;knowing. An&nbsp;hour later, he&nbsp;came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful&nbsp;I was to&nbsp;walk out and go&nbsp;home and ruin the trip last minute. I&nbsp;told him he&nbsp;caused this to&nbsp;happen, but he&nbsp;said that&nbsp;I was being so&nbsp;hard on&nbsp;his mom, it‚Äôs ridiculous.</p><p>I&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;fight any more, but he&nbsp;kept on&nbsp;berating me&nbsp;and then called my&nbsp;family to&nbsp;tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it&nbsp;was because of&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;family said that&nbsp;I shouldn‚Äôt have ruined it&nbsp;for myself and should‚Äôve sucked it&nbsp;up&nbsp;and done my&nbsp;best to&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;it.</p><p>Did I&nbsp;really overreact?</p><p><h2>Users online agree that the woman was right in&nbsp;this situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69f/09f/00e3bf5f14b99b0f46d49f766e.jpg><p>Even though the author started thinking that she overreacted, online users supported the woman in&nbsp;her decision and even suggested that she needed to&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> him.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;don‚Äôt wanna call the divorce card but... divorce.
