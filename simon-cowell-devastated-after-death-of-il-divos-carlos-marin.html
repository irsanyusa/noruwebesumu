Within his message he shared his devastation over Carlos Marin’s death. Marin was a member of the vocal group, Il Divo. This group was created by Cowell and signed by his company, Syco records.</strong></p><p>Cowell took inspiration from the musical group Three Tenors when creating II Divo in the early 2000s. To create the group, he conducted a worldwide search for young singers to take on this project. His search lasted from January 21, 2001 to December 16, 2003. After his search, he brought together Urs Bühler, Carlos Marin, David Miller, and Sébastien Izambard to form II Divo.</p><p>The group has released numerous albums during their time together, their most recent release was last July. A week before Marin’s death, the group announced they were postponing their Christmas tour until December 2022 due to ongoing illness. As of right now, the group still has scheduled tour dates early in the new year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>II Divo Loses a Band Member</h2><p>On Sunday, Marin’s bandmates confirmed his death. They shared the news of his passing on their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>website</a>:</p><p>“There will never be another voice or spirit like Carlos. For 17 years the four of us have been on this incredible journey of Il Divo together, and we will miss our dear friend. We hope and pray that his beautiful soul will rest in peace.”</p><p>On December 7, Marin tested positive for Covid-19, despite receiving the vaccination. The 53 year old was taken to the Manchester Royal Infirmary where he was placed into a medically induced coma and hooked up to breathing tubes. Unfortunately, Marin passed away in the intensive care unit. The exact cause of death has yet to be revealed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CXr2KX-I-aZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-reacts-to-carlos-marin-s-death>Simon Cowell Reacts to Carlos Marin’s Death</h2><p>After Marin’s death, Cowell published a statement on his Instagram page. After nearly 17 years of working with the singer, the music mogul shared kind words about his impact on the world. It’s clear that Cowell is hurting as much as Marin’s bandmates are right now.</p><p>“I am finding this so difficult to put into words how I feel right now. I am devastated Carlos Marin has passed away. He loved life,” Cowell shared. “He loved performing and always had so much appreciation towards the fans who supported the group from day one. Rest in peace Carlos. I will miss you.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1350360113.jpg alt="Blake Shelton Posts Behind-the-Scenes Clips of Dangerous Video Shoot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZJ2dppbAta3TnptmmZapsrN5w56YraBdpLNutctmm6Kun6h6pK3RpaasZZ2Wv6q6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
