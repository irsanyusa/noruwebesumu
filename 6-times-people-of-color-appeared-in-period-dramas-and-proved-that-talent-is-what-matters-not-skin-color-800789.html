Many people disagree with casting people of&nbsp;color in&nbsp;traditionally white characters saying that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;distortion of&nbsp;<a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a>. However, “<a href=#>colorblind casting</a>” isn’t an&nbsp;attack on&nbsp;white characters, but simply an&nbsp;opportunity for actors of&nbsp;color to&nbsp;portray characters and tell their stories.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>found 6&nbsp;beautiful movies and series that saw past skin color and allowed traditionally white characters to&nbsp;be&nbsp;played by&nbsp;people of&nbsp;color.</p><p><h2>1. Bridgerton (2020&nbsp;— )</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1a/ca9/fcd9dd53499c18dc31276ab1ec.jpg><p><a href=#>History</a> describes the aristocratic Bridgerton family that lived back in&nbsp;the 19th century as&nbsp;<strong>all-white</strong>. However, in&nbsp;the Netflix series, the majority of&nbsp;actors are of&nbsp;color and high up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the social hierarchy. Never once were the <a href=#>race</a> of&nbsp;the Queen, played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Golda Rosheuvel</a>, or&nbsp;the interracial couple up&nbsp;for debate or&nbsp;criticism. The show itself shows a&nbsp;more respectful way that people of&nbsp;color can appear in&nbsp;period dramas, without necessarily being the victims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af8/e67/f7abe45281a325ec577c53c07b.jpg><p>Showrunner Chris Van Dusen has <a href=#>said</a> that the show’s goal was to&nbsp;depict a&nbsp;world similar to&nbsp;the one we&nbsp;live in&nbsp;today. That’s why the show is&nbsp;not pure history, but also includes <strong>elements of&nbsp;<a href=# title=fantasy data-link=tag>fantasy</a></strong>. This can be&nbsp;seen throughout the first season where black people are succeeding in&nbsp;life without having anyone criticizing or&nbsp;questioning them. A&nbsp;loud example is&nbsp;Simon, the Duke of&nbsp;Hastings, played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Regé-Jean Page</a>, who is&nbsp;mentored by&nbsp;an&nbsp;upper-class Lady who is&nbsp;played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Adjoa Andoh</a>.</p><p><h2>2. The Personal History of&nbsp;David Copperfield (2019)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea1/e94/3f1c7d53fea7bfbc55131ba850.jpg><p>Even though Charles Dickens wrote the lead to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;white man, <a href=#>Armando Iannucci</a> chose to&nbsp;cast <a href=#>Dev Patel</a>, an&nbsp;actor of&nbsp;<strong>Indian descent,</strong> in&nbsp;this role. The reason he&nbsp;made this decision is&nbsp;because he&nbsp;felt that people today needed a&nbsp;fresher, more modern image of&nbsp;the character.</p><p>He&nbsp;realizes that the story takes place in&nbsp;1840, when an&nbsp;Indian man would never have had such high status. As&nbsp;<a href=#>Dev Patel</a> has said, this isn’t about racial accuracy but about universal <strong>relevancy</strong>. Dickens is&nbsp;loved all around the world and it’s important for people of&nbsp;color to&nbsp;see their own faces in&nbsp;these stories.</p><p><h2>3. Mary, Queen of&nbsp;Scots (2018)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ef/061/7e2f2f5fe2b5cd9a76c488e3b5.jpg><p><a href=#>Josie Rourke</a> was very clear when she took on&nbsp;the job as&nbsp;director of&nbsp;this movie. She wasn’t going to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;<strong>all-white cast</strong>. To&nbsp;her, it&nbsp;was very important to&nbsp;include people of&nbsp;color who had always been left out of&nbsp;period dramas. So&nbsp;she chose to&nbsp;cast a&nbsp;black actor, Adrian Lester, as&nbsp;the Queen’s ambassador, even though the <a href=#>UK&nbsp;National Archives</a> make it&nbsp;clear that this wouldn’t have been possible.</p><p>However, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;know for sure that there were many black people in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK during the Renaissance. So, in&nbsp;Rourke’s <a href=#>mind</a>, her effort was a&nbsp;restorative work where the present meets the past. And that’s why she also chose to&nbsp;cast <a href=#>Jemma Chan</a>, an&nbsp;actress of&nbsp;Asian descent, to&nbsp;portray Mary’s keeper.</p><p><h2>4. Les Miserables (2018&nbsp;— 2019)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/946/5d0/42d42a5742b34bfe03ab6f0dd4.jpg><p>When <a href=#>David Oyelowo</a> was approached by&nbsp;the BBC to&nbsp;play the part of&nbsp;Javert, he&nbsp;was, at&nbsp;the very least, intrigued. <a href=#>According to</a>&nbsp;his research, there were many black people during the story’s time that had prominent roles in&nbsp;society. Black people weren’t just servants and slaves.</p><p>Oyelowo also believes that his <strong>colorblind casting</strong> brought a&nbsp;wider audience to&nbsp;the show. More people of&nbsp;color felt closer and connected to&nbsp;the show simply because they saw someone like themselves in&nbsp;it. <a href=#>Also</a>, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;show that was closer to&nbsp;today’s society, where people of&nbsp;all colors live peacefully and equally.</p><p><h2>5. Lady Macbeth (2016)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc0/dfb/98edaf51ed96f4b3f484e2a8d4.jpg><p>Lady Macbeth, portrayed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Florence Pugh</a>, finds a&nbsp;loyal maid in&nbsp;Anna, a&nbsp;black woman played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Naomi Ackie</a>. But, she isn’t the only person of&nbsp;color in&nbsp;the movie. Lady Macbeth’s lover is&nbsp;also quite <strong>dark-skinned</strong>. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;100% <a href=#>accurate</a>, these characters weren’t written specifically for white actors.</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;mention that during the 17th century, the <a href=#>population</a> of&nbsp;black people in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK was increasing. So, hiring a&nbsp;black maid would have been very possible. However, the <a href=#>casting director</a> wants to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;clear that the film didn’t want to&nbsp;send any kind of&nbsp;social message. They were just trying to&nbsp;find the most suitable actors for their movie.</p><p><h2>6. Sanditon (2019&nbsp;— )</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/355/f83/80839b5121859397d3f67eda57.jpg><p>Jane Austen passed away in&nbsp;1817, but she made sure to&nbsp;break new grounds before then. In&nbsp;her last novel, she included the first <strong>black wealthy heiress</strong>. The young woman, who was played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Crystal Clarke</a>, appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wealthier than many of&nbsp;the white people she lives next&nbsp;to.</p><p>The actress has <a href=#>said</a> that it’s very important that a&nbsp;woman of&nbsp;color was included in&nbsp;a&nbsp;period drama and not just for diversity. She adds that black people need to&nbsp;feel truly represented and have their stories and history being told.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you agree with colorblind casting? Do&nbsp;you think that it&nbsp;messes with historical accuracy or&nbsp;that it&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;bring equality?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZINuwMimnKxloJq8sbjEZqafZZOkubC%2BjJqnqZ2Rp7KlecinZKmdop68pXnDq5immaNirq%2BwjKmpqK6VmXq1tMCtZK2ZnJq7tXnIrGSwoJGpeq6t062cq6tdo7y1edKkoKdlk6S5sL6McWdpb2hufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
