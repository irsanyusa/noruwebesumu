He has achieved two NBA championships and two Finals MVP awards, leading both the San Antonio Spurs and Toronto Raptors to titles.</p><p>Born in Los Angeles, California, Kawhi is the son of Mark Leonard and Kim Robertson. The tragedy of his father's murder in 2008 placed a lasting impact on his life. Kawhi excelled in basketball at Martin Luther King High School, where he led his team to a 30–3 record in his senior year and was named California Mr. Basketball. He was also rated a four-star recruit, noted as the No. 8 small forward nationally in 2009.</p><p>Enrolling at San Diego State University, Leonard played for two seasons with the Aztecs. He took them to two NCAA tournament appearances, reaching the Sweet 16 in his second year, and earned consensus second-team All-American honors.</p><p>He chose to forgo his remaining college eligibility to enter the 2011 NBA draft, where he was picked 15th overall by the Indiana Pacers but was immediately traded to the San Antonio Spurs. His jersey number 15 was retired by San Diego State in 2020.</p><p>Leonard's tenure with the Spurs from 2011 to 2018 saw him win an NBA championship in 2014 where he was named Finals MVP, and he took two Defensive Player of the Year awards (2015, 2016). Conflict over injury rehabilitation procedures soured his relationship with the team, however, leading to a trade request.</p><p>Subsequently, he was traded to the Toronto Raptors in 2018. In 2019, Kawhi led the Raptors to their first NBA championship and claimed his second Finals MVP award, highlighted by a dramatic winning shot in Game 7 against the Philadelphia 76ers.</p><p>Moving back to Los Angeles, Leonard signed with the Clippers in 2019. Despite suffering a knee injury requiring surgery and a subsequent year-long recovery, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. Leonard returned strong for the 2022–23 season.</p><p>Off the court, Leonard has two children with his girlfriend. He shares a connection with the NFL via his cousin, Stevie Johnson. In 2018, he signed an endorsement deal with New Balance and in 2019 filed a lawsuit against Nike over a logo copyright.</p><p>Leonard, standing 6 feet 7 inches and weighing 230 pounds, is noted for his large hands, earning him the nickname "The Claw." He is listed among the NBA career leaders for free throw percentage, playoff steals, and playoff 3-point scoring.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>June 29</a>, <a href=#>1991</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Los Angeles, California, USA<br><b>Age: <a href=#>33 years old</a></b></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Millennial</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Goat/Sheep</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Cancer</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Playing Career</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2011-06-23</a> Kawhi Leonard is selected with the 15th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Indiana Pacers and traded to the San Antonio Spurs on draft night</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2011-12-10</a> Kawhi Leonard signs a multi-year deal with the San Antonio Spurs following the conclusion of the NBA lockout</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2014-06-15</a> NBA Finals: San Antonio Spurs beat Miami Heat, 104-87 in Game 5 for 5th NBA Championship in franchise history;
