I’m so glad you’re here. <i>A version of this article also appeared in the <a href=#>It’s Not Just You</a> newsletter. <a href=# rel=noopener>Sign up</a> to get a new edition every Saturday.</i></strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>After another week of searing headlines</strong> about just about everything—global climate issues, the unfurling tragedies in Afghanistan, in Louisiana and parts south, the pandemic—all of it left me sleepless and sad and cynical. The latter is the most corrosive emotion I can think of right now, and when I’m not in that ditch, it’s getting harder to imagine what our future looks like as the sands continue to sink and shift beneath our tired feet. It’s a disorienting helpless feeling that we are powerless and that there’s no escape from these looping circles of anxiety.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I pawed around the internet looking for some good news to share here, and it became clear I’m not the only one struggling to stay out of the ditch. There were not one but two pieces circulating (from the <a href=# rel=noopener>BBC</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>The Atlantic</a>) advocating for something called “tragic optimism.” It’s a concept you might know if you’ve read Austrian psychologist and Holocaust survivor <a href=# rel=noopener>Viktor Frankl.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Anna Gotlib, a moral philosopher, defines it best for our times in <a href=# rel=noopener>a paper published </a>earlier this year: “Frankl argues that we can make suffering meaningful, view guilt as an imperative to improve ourselves, and interpret the fragility, unpredictability, and transitoriness of life as motivation to find meaning.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>✨Subscribe here to get a fresh edition of It’s Not Just You every Saturday</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gotlib <a href=# rel=noopener>points to 2020 research</a> suggesting that the people who cope better in ongoing crises do not focus on finding happiness (a particularly American obsession) or even healthy distractions from the sadness, but rather those who can acknowledge suffering without being pulled under by it. And in this case, Gotlib is not necessarily referring to the trauma of those who lost someone to COVID-19, or essential workers and medical staff on the frontlines, but all of us who’ve staggered through this period of isolation and anxiety “displaced from our usual routines, epistemically confused, and motivationally adrift.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So the question I ask is how do we keep evolving in periods of stress? Can we incorporate gratefulness into our daily thinking, or will we succumb to self-pity or avoidance of anything ugly or difficult? Stressors don’t deliver growth and perspective automatically. But if Frankl and Gotlib are correct, it’s possible to have optimism in the face of collective tragedies, comprehend our lack of control over the future, and still kindle optimism about our ability to find connection and purpose.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So in that spirit, here are a few bits of the wisdom I’ve collected from experts and readers of this newsletter. (More in future editions.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Connect, connect, connect: </strong>Cultivate casual, friendly social interactions. It could be a two-minute conversation with someone waiting for a bus with you or a barista or someone in the dairy aisle, but those little moments of humanity can infuse ordinary days with meaning. They tether us to each other and the world. Readers Chet and Stuart both stressed this idea of turning outward instead of focusing on self in their notes about staving off cynicism. And, in uncertain times, these brief exchanges signal to us that the world is a safe place; write Emily and Amelia Nagoski in <a href=# rel=noopener>Burnout: The secret to solving the stress cycle.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Spend your time like love: </strong>We vote on what means most to us with our energy and time, so consider where you’re investing your heart. Are you overspending on the actions that don’t have meaning long term, or putting your best self into things that will matter to you in 10 years, like your family or the people whose lives you influence? As Henry Thoreau put it: “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” (With thanks to readers Linda, Tjong-Liem, Bea, and Chet for their thoughts on this topic.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Let happiness ensue, rather than chasing it</strong> (to paraphrase <a href=# rel=noopener>Viktor Frankl</a>). Being alive means you’re in a state of flux, and if you think of wellness and happiness things you can achieve with the right ingredients and habits, you will be exhausted trying to hang on to stasis. But if you change your expectations and see joy as a random by-product in the quest for purpose, you’ll feel delighted rather than deprived. Or as the Nagoski sisters write in <a href=# rel=noopener>Burnout</a>:</p><figure class=text-center readability=29.5><p><strong>To be ‘well’ is not to live in a state of perpetual safety and calm, but to move fluidly from a state of adversity, risk, adventure, or excitement, back to safety and calm, and out again.</strong></p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>✨Subscribe here to get a fresh edition of It’s Not Just You every Saturday</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>GALLERY 📷</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Photos from the week that was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/INJY-MeirKayFOUR.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>On an unspeakably hot day,</strong> I was walking past the Brooklyn Public Library with its gorgeous<a href=# rel=noopener> bronze doors</a> when I saw this “Compliments Chair” and a man inviting people to sit down and accept sincere compliments.
