The name is so reminiscent of luxury, sensuality and high-quality because couverture chocolate is indeed a higher class of chocolate. All chocolates are manufactured in the same way with sweeteners, cocoa solids and cocoa butter. There are typically additives such as milk powder, soy lecithin and vanilla to enhance the flavor of the chocolate.</p><p>As typically the low-cost alternative, compound chocolate is created with a combination that uses a lower percentage of cocoa butter and cocoa solids. Actually, more often than not, the process of creating compound chocolate completely eliminates the use of cocoa butter and replaces it with oil.</p><p>Chocolate is a fine experience for the palate because of the presence of cocoa. Without cocoa butter, the chocolaty flavor is diminished and no substitute can compare. As such, bakers give up the taste of, and the experience of consuming, true chocolate when using compound chocolate.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Once you have tasted, used and savored the experience of having couverture chocolate, there is no going back to the fake stuff. This point of no return is created because couverture is not just a treat for the taste buds (even though one bite will have them celebrating in delight). Couverture chocolate is a treat that excites all the senses. The way it snaps makes the ears want to follow the sound. The glossy finish is pleasing to the eye. The scent can be called nothing short of enticing.</p><p>We at Dùne understand the one-of-a-kind experience that comes with consuming couverture chocolate and as Nigeria’s premiere couverture producer, we are dedicated to ensuring that no one is denied this pleasure hence why we make couverture chocolate available at a low price not typically seen.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-bef58ea7-1adb-44de-9efe-dff429572bbb data-caption="30-gram bars of Dùne 55% Cocoa Dark Chocolate"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/eduktkpTURBXy8zODk3ZTE5MGY0ZWY0NmY2NDRjNWMwOTRiNjJmMTJjMC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAlHCww></span><p><strong>Couverture Chocolate vs. Compound Chocolate</strong></p><p>The sad truth is that more often than not, the type of chocolate used to create desserts and baked goods is compound chocolate. Even the stuff you find on grocery shelves is normally compound chocolate. This commonality has nothing to do with quality, flavor, aroma or texture, however.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Partly, this typical use of compound chocolate is attributed to many people not knowing that there is better quality available. The next factor is cost. Compound chocolate is more often cheaper to purchase compared to couverture chocolate.</p><p>Compound chocolate is so common and usually cheaper because it is easier to produce. This ease, and the subsequent drop in quality, comes from the use of cocoa powder instead of real cocoa solids.</p><p>Cocoa butter is also typically substituted with compound chocolate. Oils like coconut oil, vegetable oil and palm kernel oil are the usual substitutes. These properties mean that compound chocolate has a higher melting point in addition to it not requiring tempering. Chocolate tempering, which is the process of heating and cooling chocolate so that it stabilizes enough to make confections and candies. The process prevents the chocolate from melting easily when touched, gives the chocolate a smooth, glossy finish and allows a beautiful set when used for covering or dipping treats.</p><p>For the best taste and finished product, cheaper is not better. Instead, for authentic chocolate flavor, easier handling and a more aesthetically-pleasing end product, real quality chocolate AKA couverture chocolate should be used. Couverture chocolate is made using cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Cocoa butter percentage in couverture chocolate must be at least 30% to guarantee that delicious flavor. Some of Dùne <a href=# id=605c5285-f7fa-4dc8-ab65-acbbcf88856e>chocolate</a> contains as much as 70% cocoa.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9d8c660a-0c22-44f7-b77d-a487c371827c data-caption="Hand tempered, 30-gram bars of Dùne 70% Cocoa Dark Chocolate"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/83QktkpTURBXy9lOGFlYzU3YWY2N2FiYWNmN2JmOWRkNjM1YWVlNGM0OC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAlHCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The luxurious chocolate requires tempering for a smooth, glossy finish, crisp snap and hardness. The anatomy of couverture chocolate means that it is easier to handle and work with because it does not melt as easily as compound chocolate to the touch.</p><p>The superior quality of couverture chocolate comes from the quality of cocoa beans used. We at Dùne use the finest quality cocoa beans that are sourced locally in Nigeria. We also ensure the cocoa beans are stored using the best practices for a wholesome, fresh taste every time.</p><p>How couverture chocolate is manufactured also plays a major role in its superior quality. The smooth, creamy texture and deeper flavor are gained from the cocoa being ground much finer during production.</p><p><strong>The Benefits of Couverture Chocolate</strong></p><p>Because of its higher cocoa butter content, there are quite a number of benefits that can be derived from consuming couverture chocolates. These benefits include:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><ul class=list><li>Aiding in hardening tooth enamel due to the presence of a compound known as theobromine.</li><li>Helping cure coughs due to the presence of theobromine.</li><li>Aiding in lowering the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.</li><li>Aiding in reducing the risk of developing arteriosclerosis, which is a condition whereby the walls of arteries become thickened and obstruct blood flow. Properties in cocoa butter help ensure that blood vessels retain an appropriate thickness that allows the free flow of blood.</li><li>Aiding in reducing the risk of developing kidney disease.</li><li>Aiding in lower bad cholesterol and maintaining a healthy cholesterol level by being a source of good-for-you HDL cholesterol.</li><li>Aiding in improving the appearance of skin due to anti-aging properties.</li></ul><p>Is there any better reason for consuming couverture chocolate than improved overall health? Couverture chocolate makes enjoying your favorite chocolate treats good for your health.</p><p><strong>How Couverture Chocolate is Made</strong></p><p>We at Dùne cannot speak on the process that other couverture chocolate manufacturers use with absolute certainty, but we can break down our process for ensuring superior taste, texture and overall quality.</p><p>Here is the step by step breakdown:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><ul class=list><li>The first thing we at Dùne do is select only the finest beans in a meticulous process.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the selection process is complete, we blend the beans in just the right quantity so that only the best flavor and texture is achieved.</li><li>The whole beans are roasted to develop the flavor and aroma.</li><li>The beans are refined so that cocoa liquor is formed.</li><li>Only the most superior ingredients are added to further develop the flavor, aroma and texture.</li><li>The chocolate is mixed in the art of conching for the flavor to really pop on the consumer’s tongue.</li><li>We temper and mold the chocolate to create chocolate bars.</li></ul><p>Our process is not fancy or complicated but with its simplicity comes a quality that is unmatched.</p><p><strong>How to Use Couverture Chocolate</strong></p><p>Couverture chocolate is delicious when enjoyed as it comes out of the packaging. The flavor is astounding and the chocolate melts smoothly on the tongue.</p><p>Couverture chocolate is also ideal for dipping and tempering, and thus, is great for use in any candy recipe. It can be used to make cover truffles, clusters and chocolate bars in addition to being used for dipping fruits, cakes and more. The healthy snap once it is bitten into gives candy life and adds a beautiful shine to any recipe.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The deep chocolate flavor also makes couverture chocolate great for baking where appropriate. The use of couverture chocolate in baking is dependent on the recipe. Because of the higher cocoa butter percentage, it does not behave in the same way as melted chocolate, which is typically used in brownies and cakes. Therefore, couverture chocolate is best used in recipes that require a different proportion of fat to sugar and cocoa butter.
