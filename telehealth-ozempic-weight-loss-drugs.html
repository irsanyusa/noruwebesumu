But consumers are more likely to say what they hear about the medications is positive than negative. Nearly half (44%) of U.S. adults who were aware of weight-loss efforts with GLP-1 drugs said the content they saw, read or heard was positive, 23 percentage points higher than those who said it was negative.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Most consumers who are interested in GLP-1 drugs are keen to use telehealth to procure them&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">With awareness of GLP-1 drugs on the rise, some companies are turning to telehealth options to try to lower the barrier of entry for consumers.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Eli Lilly, the maker of Zepbound and Mounjaro, recently launched a new platform called LillyDirect, which connects people with a telehealth company that can prescribe weight loss medications. The pharmaceutical company <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>said</a> it created LillyDirect to make it easier for patients who are having a difficult time accessing the drugs, and to ensure the medications that patients are receiving are not compounded or counterfeit versions. The platform is the first of its kind from a pharmaceutical company, though other health-focused companies like WeightWatchers and Ro offer similar services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">These services look poised to further drive the weight loss drug craze. Among those interested in drugs like Ozempic for weight loss, nearly three-fourths (73%) say they’re interested in obtaining the medications via a telehealth service.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Concerns about GLP-1s remain, especially among those interested in the drugs for weight loss</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Still, consumers have myriad concerns about GLP-1s for weight loss, especially those interested in the medications. In fact, people who are interested in drugs like Ozempic —&nbsp;and as a result may have done more research into them — are more likely to be concerned about every potential worry we asked about.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though the heightened concern among interested parties is somewhat intuitive, it also shows there are still barriers to wider adoption, even if it's easier to access the drugs. It could also explain why interest in drugs like Ozempic for weight loss has not increased despite relatively positive media coverage. Nearly 3 in 10 (28%) of U.S. adults said they are interested in trying GLP-1s as a weight-loss method, on par with the 29% that said the same in April.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While there isn’t a simple fix to addressing many concerns, especially those related to cost and side effects, more time and research is key. For example, if drugmakers are able to continue to demonstrate success with their medications — especially as it relates to the prevention of more serious health conditions such as heart attacks and strokes — more insurers may cover the medication. That could help bring down the $1,000- to $1,500-per-month list price for the popular drugs.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6myrbHHnpilrJhivLuxzKmgnGWnmraotNNmo6iro2Kxs8HGrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
