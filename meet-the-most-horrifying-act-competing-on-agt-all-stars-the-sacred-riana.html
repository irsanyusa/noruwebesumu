After gaining a huge following thanks to her multiple Got Talent runs, The Sacred Riana takes the scariest illusionism to America’s Got Talent All Stars. Let’s get to know more about the character as we look more into the background of the nightmare fuel that is her act.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-sacred-riana-competes-on-agt-all-stars>The Sacred Riana Competes on AGT All Stars</h2><p>AGT All Stars aims to bring together well-known acts from all over the world that have previously competed on AGT and the <a href=#>Got Talent</a> franchise. Additionally, the news that the 60 Acts will return to the stage in 2023 is undoubtedly bringing together viral sensations and fan favorites from around the world, most notably, The Sacred Riana.</p><p>The real person behind the “sacred,” 190-year-old Riana is Marie Antoinette Riana Graharani, an Indonesian magician and illusionist. Portraying the character is not a difficult task for her, as she already finds interest in the macabre even at an early age.</p><p>According to her manager Bow Vernon from Trilogy Magic Factory, the character was perfect for Graharani, who is naturally quiet and a bit shy. She managed to wow the judges with the consistency of staying in character at all times. Even after winning $100,000 on Asia’s Got Talent she remains true to her persona, though there are some that criticized her for the lack of emotion after winning.</p><p>Together with her mysterious doll, Riani, she will perform more unexplainable magic that will haunt the dreams of any who witnessed it. The Sacred Riana is still an enigma to her audience, but the mystery behind the character and what she will do next is why everyone is awaiting her return on the stage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her Manager Claims She Has Real Telekinetic Abilities</h2><p>Telekinesis is the ability to manipulate objects through the power of thought and is a popular fictional superpower.&nbsp;The Sacred <a href=#>Riana</a> has showcased the use of telekinesis before, but what most fans don’t know is that her manager claims that it’s all real.</p><p>All other aspects of the act, according to Vernon, were tricks, but Riana’s telekinesis was genuine and was discovered when she was about 15 years old. He even went as far as to say that The Sacred Riana is practicing her telekinetic powers to improve it and use it more effectively.</p><p>“She really has telekinetic powers. It’s always been there before and she’s training herself further,” Vernon said.</p><p>Although the idea of somebody having real powers is far-fetched, it only brings more excitement and anticipation to what she’s able to do. The claims may just be there to add more lore and mystery to her character to bring in more people wanting to watch her act.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Aidan-McCann-AGT-All-Stars-220x147.png alt="‘AGT: All-Stars’ Recap: Heidi Klum Hits Golden Buzzer for Young Magician" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWknbJuuc6sq2agn6e%2FqrLYoqWgZZGYwW6vzqannqyZo7Ruu81mmKCsXZa5rXnSrZirq12ptaZ50pqaq52UYr%2Bqrc2aZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
