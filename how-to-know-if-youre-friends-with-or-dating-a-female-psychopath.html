No matter how bad they have acted, it’s never their fault, but the other person’s or circumstances beyond their control.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>They are indirectly aggressive</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>They use indirect forms of aggression, such as malicious gossip, stonewalling, harsh insults, verbal assault, excluding and isolating people, and forming alliances to ‘destroy’ the other person .</p><p>So while they may or may not get physical, they thrive in being passive aggressive.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>They have a bad temper</h3></p><p>Female psychopaths may become angry and snap at people, calling them names or using harsh language.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9590cd71-563d-42b3-99b3-74cb278e9a21 data-caption="Female psychopaths have a bad anger [Medium]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/2tlktkqTURBXy80M2NiZDA0YWFjNjIyYjk3Y2IxZTcwM2Q0YzQ5YWFjZi5qcGVnkZUCzQKpzQHDwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>They have a harder time controlling anger, often feeling relieved after lashing out, and may even feel entitled and justified in their violent outbursts.</p><p>The ability to manage their anger is considerably harder for female psychopaths than it is for male psychopaths.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>Female psychopaths get close and intimate with their victims</h3></p><p>One common trait among female psychopaths is their ability to manipulate their victims into forming a relationship with them, often by using seduction or sex as a weapon.</p><p>They tend to exploit their victim's wealth or status through deceitful and scheming behaviour. Female psychopaths are far more likely to victimise people they know than male psychopaths, who typically attack strangers.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>They are deceptive and full of lies</h3></p><p>They also use deceptive tactics to get what they want.</p><p>Female psychopaths are particularly cunning and sly.
