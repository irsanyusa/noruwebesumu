With the country plagued by mass unemployment, they are forced to scrape by with informal work.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The disparity is in the spotlight because the Oxfam scandal has highlighted an apparent sense of impunity among some actors in the aid community.</p><p>"NGOs have more money than the Haitian state so there is a fear. The police are helpless," Haitian lawyer Mario Joseph said.</p><p>"They come to support the rights of women and children and it's they themselves who, through economic power, take advantage of the country's weaknesses to commit abuse, rape, knowing that there is this impunity because the state does not demand accountability."</p><p>Joseph said the economic clout of the NGOs can color their relationship with the country's authorities.</p><p>"Oxfam could have had a better response. The flaw in their approach was that they did not report illegal acts to police," Joseph said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"This would have led to an investigation and would have brought those involved to justice. Instead they are still carrying out a so-called internal investigation."</p><p>Time for a blacklist?</p><p>Shaken by revelations that some of its staff used prostitutes in both Haiti and Chad, Oxfam has denied covering up misconduct.</p><p>The allegations, which triggered the resignation of Oxfam's deputy chief Penny Lawrence, revolve around Roland van Hauwermeiren who was Oxfam's country director for Haiti and previously the head of the charity's mission in Chad.</p><p>Oxfam investigated sexual misconduct allegations in 2011 and van Hauwermeiren was one of three staff members who resigned, while four others were dismissed.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The scandal widened Tuesday after fresh claims against the charity of sexual assault and cover-up in South Sudan.</p><p>The fact that van Hauwermeiren has been able to continue working in the aid world is shocking to some NGO workers in Haiti.</p><p>"My biggest issue is knowing that someone accused and found guilty of sexual exploitation has been able to find work in other countries," one staffer said.</p><p>"Many are calling for the creation of a blacklist in the humanitarian community," she said, adding that "unfortunately, the humanitarian world is not alone in facing the repercussions of a male-dominated culture."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXywxMWapGaaop7Bqr%2FHZpqhmaKewbp50pyYp5yRoXq0vM6to6KfmKnAbrjAnKJmp5Ziu6i7jKitnqqjnrSpwIyipWaon6S%2Fbq%2FOrqWtqpmawHCwj6mbbrGd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
