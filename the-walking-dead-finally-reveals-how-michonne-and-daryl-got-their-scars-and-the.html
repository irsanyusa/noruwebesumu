Daryl was branded first before Joceyln ordered a child to brand her old friend, Michonne.</p><p>The scenes are incredibly difficult to watch as both scream out in pain. It was also one of the toughest scenes to direct.</p><p>"We were physically in a very small space and to have the kids actually put the brand... We had a stand-in that did not understand it. We had to replace the stand-in, because the stand-in was freaked out by it. But our lead kids were not," episode director Millicent Shelton told INSIDER of how tough it was to film the branding scene.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="twd 914 michonne daryl"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/fREktkuTURBXy9mMWRlZjIxMC0zZmI1LTQ2NzAtYmI1ZC1hYzI1YWU2MTNmNzEuanBlZ5GVAs0DFs0CD8LD></span><p>"It was very uncomfortable for Norm and Danai to be hanging from those poles," Shelton added.</p><p>That final moment where Michonne screams out in pain and then extends herself out towards Jocelyn wasn't planned.</p><p>"For me, the most uncomfortable thing to watch as a director, but I'm so glad they left it in the cut, is when Michonne gets branded and she screamed and she leans. And she leans forward into Jocelyn's face," said Shelton. "Rutina was standing next to that [camera] operator and Danai leaned so far forward, he stepped back and panned [the camera]."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-0a06f289-264f-4934-82f3-f75860ae1604 data-caption="michonne jocelyn twd 914"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/AhtktktTURBXy9iNzZmZDUzMC1mNGUyLTRlNjctYmRjMi1jMDk5YmNjMzVkZjYucG5nkZUCzQMWzQGLwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"It was unexpecting and he got that profile and I let it play and I was just like, 'Oh my God!' And I was just holding my breath. It was so powerful. It was just the most powerful moment," said Shelton.</p><p>In that one moment, so many feelings are conveyed. There's the pain Michonne is experiencing from the branding mixed with the pain of looking into your former friend's eyes and screaming out, wondering how they could betray you like that and then let this happen to you all while you're with child.</p><p><strong>Fans felt the intensity of the scene as well as they responded to how Daryl and Michonne wound up with the brands.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme9OhnGavkaG4qrrGZpuemZRis6q6wKWjsmWimsOmrcusZKGnp2K6qq%2FHqKWnnV2Wu6V5w5qpsqRdnLy1edOhnKKqXaiwor7SZpinnF2ptaZ7x6SfqW5lmg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
