By the end of the night, she ended up in the Battle Royale once again with <a href=#>new contestant Macaw</a>.</p><p>For his solo performance, Macaw sang “Live Like You Were Dying” by Tim McGraw, showing off an impressive voice. Guesses from the panel about Macaw’s identity included Elijah Wood, Zayn Malik, and Doug Robb.</p><p>For the Battle Royale, Fairy and Macaw both performed “That Don’t Impress Me Much” by Shania Twain in their own styles. The panel was torn about who to vote for, as they felt that both contestants delivered great performances. However, Macaw was ultimately chosen to move on.</p><p>That meant that Fairy had to be unmasked. Final guesses from the panel included Tracee Ellis Ross, Corinne Foxx, and Lori Harvey. None of the panelists correctly guessed that it was Holly Robinson Peete under the mask. She had a special connection to last week’s theme, Sesame Street, as her father starred on the show.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL PLAYER DAMAR HAMLIN APPEARS WITH LITTLE BROTHER ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-axolotl-unmasked-as-wwe-s-alexa-bliss>Axolotl Unmasked as WWE’s Alexa Bliss</h3><p>Wednesday’s new episode also featured a performance from new contestant Axolotl, who shared that she had been bullied when she was younger and hinted that she might be married to a famous singer. She performed “Can’t Fight the Moonlight” by Leann Rimes.</p><p>Unfortunately, Axolotl didn’t earn enough votes to participate in the Battle Royale, so she had to be unmasked. Guesses from the panel included Nikki and Brie Garcia (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">formerly Bella</a>) and gymnast McKayla Maroney.</p><p>However, only Jenny McCarthy was correct in guessing that Axolotl was actually WWE superstar Alexa Bliss, who is married to singer Ryan Cabrera. The star admitted that she had stage fright about singing, but encouraged people to do what scares them, because it pays off.</p><p>Next week, we’ll get to see a whole new group of contestants take the stage for ’80s Night.
