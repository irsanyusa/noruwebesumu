The show challenges celebrities to recreate moments from the iconic 1987 movie. This is the final round of the competition before the finale next week.</strong></p><p>This week, the remaining three couples had some heart-to-heart conversations about what the competition means to them. Last week’s winning couple, Corbin Bleu and Cat Cora, had a particularly emotional chat about their experiences growing up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-real-dirty-dancing-s-corbin-bleu-cat-cora-get-emotional>‘The Real Dirty Dancing’s Corbin Bleu, Cat Cora Get Emotional</h2><p>Corbin, who previously finished in second place on Dancing with the Stars Season 17, opened up to Cat about his experience growing up as a mixed-race kid. He got emotional as he said that he was “not Black enough, but clearly not white enough.”</p><p>The High School Musical actor went on to share that he used to watch a lot of musicals when he was younger, admiring the “strong male leads,” who were usually white. He said he “never saw somebody like myself” in those stories, so this competition means a lot to him.</p><p>Celebrity chef Cat Cora, meanwhile, shared that her family didn’t have a lot of money when she was growing up, but they had “a lot of love.” She came out as gay to her parents when she was 19, and they supported her. Cat got choked up as she shared that both her mother and father passed away of cancer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CaBGA-AvF7h/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>LONI LOVE, BRIE BELLA TEAR UP IN EMOTIONAL ‘REAL DIRTY DANCING’ MOMENT</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-corbin-cat-are-driven-to-win-the-show>Corbin, Cat Are Driven to Win the Show</h3><p>Corbin and Cat were the winning couple during last week’s show, and they were driven to do even better during this week’s competition to hopefully be named the ultimate Baby and Johnny during the finale.</p><p>The pair also get along really well.
