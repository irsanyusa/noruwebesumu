They made it to the finale with their creative chain reactions.</p><p>For their final topple on the show, the team chose “International Treasure Quest” as their theme. The creation involved clues and puzzle boxes that eventually revealed the treasure. The set-up even featured a waterfall of blue dominos as well as collapsing pyramids.</p><p>The complex creation ran exactly as it was supposed to, so it was no surprise that the Dominerds were named Domino Masters winners. Brains & Brawn were the runners-up, while Mechanical Mavericks took third place.</p><p>Alex and Derek said in <a href=# class=broken_link>an interview</a> that they were inspired to start building domino creations when they saw an America’s Got Talent contestant named the Kinetic King, who created chain reactions during Season 6.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>MEET THE JUDGES OF NEW COMPETITION SERIES ‘DOMINO MASTERS’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-the-show-get-a-second-season-on-fox>Will the Show Get a Second Season on FOX?</h3><p>Now that Season 1 of Domino Masters is complete and the winners have been named, you might be wondering if the show will be renewed for a second season.
