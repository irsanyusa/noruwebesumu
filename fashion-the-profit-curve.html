Instead of the usual collection of he-men modeling pipes, brogues and rakish hats, there was a sylphlike female clad only in a scanty girdle.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The ad was an attempt by Chicago’s H. W. Gossard Co., one of the biggest U.S. foundation garment makers, to make men “girdle conscious.” It hoped that its recumbent model—who, of course, was so well-formed that she had not the slightest need for a girdle—would make men take another look at their wives and hustle them around to the store for a tighter or, at least, better fit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This was a new sales tactic in the corset industry. But Gossard was in the midst of a $600,000-a-year ad campaign (double last year’s), which it hoped would make it the biggest company in the field. With a potential market of 55 million women over the age of 15, U.S. corset & brassiere makers now sell $400 million worth of goods a year, are heading even higher. Of the more than 350 companies in the industry, almost half have been started within the past ten years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To help Gossard cash in on this huge boom, the directors fortnight ago elected a new president: Gonzague Alexander Savard, 47, a plump, hustling French Canadian who had climbed from office boy to president in 31 years by his talent for production and labor relations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Gossard was strikebound last summer and the garment workers could not come to terms with President Lee Varley, who has now retired, it was Savard who stepped in and settled the trouble. The strike, coupled with reduced promotional activities, had clipped Gossard’s profit 82% last year. When Savard moved into his new job last week, a bunch of roses from the garment workers’ union was on his desk. Said Savard: “Our competitors ran while we stood still, but now we’re going to run.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Curves & Kangaroos. Gossard was founded on a corset-string in 1900 by a Chicago buttons & bows dealer named Henry Williamson Gossard. At the time, corsets were laced from the rear and the agonized, swaybacked “Kangaroo figure” of the Gibson Girl was the vogue. In Paris, Gossard bought a dozen corsets which were not only straight and more comfortable than U.S. models, but which laced conveniently up the front (thus obviating the need for a maid or husband at the other end of the drawstrings).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gossard dubbed his model L’lrresistible, sold the first dozen fast in the U.S. for a whopping $50 apiece (v. the average price of $1.50 for American corsets), and soon was producing a simplified $5 version of his own. He standardized for the mass market by classifying the female body into nine “ideal figures”—which weren’t so much ideal as they were all-inclusive. Samples: “The Ideal Curved-Back Figure,” “The Ideal Large-Below-the-Waist Figure.” He also shrewdly marked his corsets two inches smaller than they actually were so women wouldn’t squeeze themselves to death.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Gossard soon ran into one ideal figure that he hadn’t bargained for: the boyish form of the ’20s, when many a flapper discarded her corsets entirely, and some even wore tight bindings to flatten out their bosoms. Some corsetiers folded under this frontal assault. Not only did the Gossard company survive (Founder Henry retired in 1923) by turning out the flimsiest excuses for girdles, but it even bought out six competitors to form Associated Apparel Industries, Inc., then the biggest outfit in the business.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No Wobble. Though the Associated combine was liquidated after the crash, Gossard continued to make money, helped by the economies of Production Man Savard and Paris dressmakers’ rediscovery of curves. Gossard also helped develop a lightweight, two-way stretch fabric called powernet (used by all big corset and girdle makers today), and got a long lead by using it first. Says Savard proudly: “The fattest kind of woman doesn’t wobble when she wears powernet.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite the materials shortages of World War II, Gossard kept its sales up by such new products as the high-backed “curvette” for women war workers, to ease the strain of long hours in factories. When the New Look came in and dressmakers talked blithely of the “natural bust,” perhaps without a brassiere, Gossard quickly added: “The natural rounded bust, but with an uplift.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Noticeable Trends. Gossard has not only had to keep up with the changing fads of fashions but with the changing American female figure. In teen-age girls, Gossard has found a “very noticeable trend” towards bigger busts, smaller waists and bigger hips. And the company also has to fit figure variations in different parts of the U.S. Said Savard: “New York women have bigger busts. Dallas women are either taller or else they wear corsets down to their knees.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All told, Gossard is selling more than 500 foundation items in “The Gossard line of beauty,” including strapless bras and bodices and “mystifiers” (trade name for falsies). This year it expects to gross more than $10 million, and net more than its 1948 peak of $632,000. President Savard is convinced that the American woman is now sold on sensible foundation garments, fights shy of fads that try to squeeze her in or make her figure what it isn’t. What she wants, said Savard, is “freedom with control.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tam1mZoFwssCsn6KnnmLBqbGMqamonpmpeqTB0a%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
