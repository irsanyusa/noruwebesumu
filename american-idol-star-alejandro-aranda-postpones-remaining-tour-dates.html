At this time, the singer has not revealed a reason to the postponement. Fans of the singer have expressed their concern over the sudden announcement.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alejandro-aranda-cancels-unplugged-tour>Alejandro Aranda Cancels Unplugged Tour</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> alum was supposed to hit the road from September 23 to October 2 for an eight-date tour. However, after his performance for the Firefly Festival in Dover Heights, Delaware, Aranda revealed the saddening news.</p><p>In a plain black background, the American Idol <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">runner-up</a> posted a photo with the text, “Unfortunately, we are postponing the remaining unplugged tour dates. Reach out to your point of purchase for more info. I promise to get back out on the road very soon.”</p><p>Aranda also expressed appreciation in an Instagram story to pianist-saxophonist Cody Dear and pop star MAX for making him smile during the bad time.</p><p>Additionally, his tour partner Covey, also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">informed </a>his fans that he would not be heading on tour with Aranda due to reasons “out of my control.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Wished Aranda Well Amid Tour Postponement</h2><p>Upon the announcement, fans were quick to offer their love and support for Aranda. This isn’t the first time a rather large headlining artist has postponed their tour in the past few months. Former The Voice mega mentor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shawn Mendes</a> recently canceled his tour due to mental health issues.</p><p>Although fans are in the dark about what prompted the postponement, they’re hoping Aranda is okay.</p><p>“Take some time for yourself and come back stronger when you’re ready!” a fan wrote.</p><p>Other fans reminded Aranda to stay true to himself while others advised him to keep following his heart. In the thick of Aranda’s downing days, he is indeed lucky for having understanding supporters.</p><p>“We’re rooting for you! Your music saves lives so just keep writing and keep playing!” another fan commented.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Used to Talk About Retiring from Music</h2><p>For those who may not know, Aranda once shared his thoughts on Twitter about wanting to quit his music career. The tweet was deleted eventually.</p><p>“Sometimes I feel like my opportunity to be a full time musician/artist is fading,” he wrote. “Maybe it’s time to rethink the music career. Might go to culinary school or try to open up a coffee shop! Who knows!! Legit just having late-night thoughts.”</p><p>Apparently, the Unplugged tour is not the first time that Aranda has postponed his gigs. He also pulled out his concert tour in the United Kingdom in 2019, mentioning exhaustion as the cause. Furthermore, he abruptly broke off his schedule on the last day of Outside Lands Festival at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California, back in 2021.</p><p>Aranda has been <a href=# class=broken_link>honest</a> to his fans concerning his struggles in touring. While Aranda’s team has not disclosed any details why the acoustic tour was postponed, fans guessed mental health as the core reason, as well as low ticket sales.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Voice-Parijita-Bastola.png alt="‘The Voice’ Recap: 17-Year-Old Makes History with Four-Chair Turn" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Alejandro Aranda</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2arpJa%2Fbq3LnqGappSnvG6t0ZqlnZldpby0wM%2BopZ6rXaeyrq3Ip6Cnn12pvLa%2BjJ2YrZ2jZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
