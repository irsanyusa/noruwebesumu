However, it&nbsp;can buy the appearance of&nbsp;these things. <a href=#>Ishii Yuichi</a>, a&nbsp;man from <a href=# title=Japan data-link=tag>Japan</a>, came up&nbsp;with the idea for people to&nbsp;hire actors to&nbsp;play the roles of&nbsp;a&nbsp;husband, wife, or&nbsp;parent. Yuichi has also joined this “real-life” stage and now has more than 100 “wives” and many kids&nbsp;— and some of&nbsp;them are sure that he’s their real father.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> find these unusual relationships very intriguing and can’t wait to&nbsp;tell our readers about them.</p><p><h2>How it&nbsp;all started</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb8/050/bfe365541aa7f9fccf5bb91c83.jpg><p>Japan is&nbsp;known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;country with very strong traditions that have been passed down from generation to&nbsp;generation. But what if&nbsp;you don’t have parents to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;your wedding or&nbsp;your family lives too far to&nbsp;support you on&nbsp;your graduation day? What if&nbsp;the father of&nbsp;your child made the choice not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;its life but you want your kid to&nbsp;have both parents at&nbsp;their school concert?</p><p><h2>Why people needed&nbsp;it</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/44f/ced/0e777450e282b37264b199b2e7.jpg><p>Ishii Yuichi saw that thousands of&nbsp;people in&nbsp;his country were affected by&nbsp;not being able to&nbsp;show what’s expected of&nbsp;them, so&nbsp;one day he&nbsp;came with the idea that if&nbsp;you can’t have a&nbsp;family for your very special day, you can simply... rent one. For lots of&nbsp;people, this became a&nbsp;viable solution.</p><p><h2>The beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;long journey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/132/e2b/a18d55568984d6414302ab23a5.jpg><p>It&nbsp;all <a href=#>started</a> with Yuichi’s friend. “I&nbsp;played a&nbsp;father for a&nbsp;12-year-old with a&nbsp;single mother. The girl was <a href=# title=bullied data-link=tag>bullied</a> because she didn’t have a&nbsp;dad, so&nbsp;the mother rented&nbsp;me. I’ve acted as&nbsp;the girl’s father ever since. I’m the only real father that she knows,” the friend explained. “If&nbsp;the client never reveals the truth, I&nbsp;must continue the role indefinitely. If&nbsp;the daughter gets married, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;act as&nbsp;a&nbsp;father at&nbsp;that wedding, and then I’ll have to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;grandfather.”</p><p><h2>Grown into 100</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bfe/d36/dd4360561981ea762e6301d6ee.jpg><p>It&nbsp;may sound fake but if&nbsp;the illusion of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;father stopped the bullying and helped this little girl grow into a&nbsp;confident young lady, it&nbsp;probably was worth&nbsp;it. Let’s not judge. “I&nbsp;always ask every client, ’Are you prepared to&nbsp;sustain this lie?’ It’s the most significant problem our company has,” Yuichi explained. Since then, he&nbsp;has been playing roles of&nbsp;somebody’s husband or&nbsp;father so&nbsp;many times that he&nbsp;thinks he&nbsp;might have more than 100 “wives.”</p><p><h2>Lie or&nbsp;solution? That’s the question...</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/695/3e2/5e993e5258b287e67e3a989b8a.jpg><p>Clients ask for very different kinds of&nbsp;roles. Sometimes Ishii Yuichi is&nbsp;asked to&nbsp;accompany a&nbsp;woman to&nbsp;different functions as&nbsp;her husband. Each client has unique requests and expectations and Yuichi has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kind, caring, adventurous, or&nbsp;shy, depending on&nbsp;what’s being asked of&nbsp;him. He&nbsp;even played the role of&nbsp;the groom a&nbsp;few times for women who were under too much pressure from their families.</p><p><h2>100 wives and counting</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33d/2f5/125c365dd3be8097dac19271eb.jpg><p>A&nbsp;family member is&nbsp;not the only option. “I&nbsp;couldn’t find a&nbsp;friend who could give speeches on&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href=#>wedding day</a>. I&nbsp;was very shy and for this reason, many of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends were also shy, and when&nbsp;I asked a&nbsp;real friend to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;speech, I&nbsp;was told that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;embarrassing to&nbsp;speak in&nbsp;public. Ishii Yuichi was very kind and polite and gave a&nbsp;speech like a&nbsp;real friend,” wrote one of&nbsp;his clients.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d0/fc5/13db5559fa90794cd590bb019d.jpg><p>You can also arrange <a href=#>morning calls</a>. “I&nbsp;lost my&nbsp;father and mother when&nbsp;I was young and my&nbsp;parents never woke me&nbsp;up, so&nbsp;I like to&nbsp;hear, ’Good morning, get up!’” one client explained. It&nbsp;sounds so&nbsp;simple, but for somebody, it&nbsp;was very important.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da4/19e/34d53f5bb1a7acdbab1fff6a7c.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you just need <a href=#>companionship</a>, Ishii Yuichi and his agency can also help you with that. One client wrote, “I’ve been busy recently and haven’t been able to&nbsp;spend much time with my&nbsp;friends. Every day is&nbsp;boring because there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;companionship. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;upload photos on&nbsp;my&nbsp;Facebook or&nbsp;blog that will give me ’likes’.”</p><p><h2>If&nbsp;that’s what people need, it’s worth&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78f/7c7/802b5d51d48de0983e9c8277ec.jpg><p>We’re all so&nbsp;different&nbsp;— every one of&nbsp;us has rules, beliefs, and expectations. The people who are involved in&nbsp;this story made ones of&nbsp;their own which are pretty different from traditional standards. But if&nbsp;it&nbsp;made them happy, maybe we&nbsp;should just be&nbsp;happy for them.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think?
