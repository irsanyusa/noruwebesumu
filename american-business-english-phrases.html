Politeness</strong></h3><p><span>The last point to keep in mind when using Business English in America is to use </span><span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">polite phrases</a></strong></span><span>. You’ll notice that many of the phrases in sections 3 and 4 are not entirely straightforward in that they include words like unfortunately, sorry, a bit, and quite. These words are used to lessen the strength of a certain phrase, which is one of the main ways that American English incorporates politeness into the language.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Improve your chances of acing your interview and sign up for your free 7-day English from Lingoda.
