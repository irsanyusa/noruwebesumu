We analyse the viewers of these programmes, and how reflective they are of the programmes themselves.</h3><p>The Made in Chelsea (<b>MIC</b>) cast are known for their distinctive accents, regular coffee dates and lack of day jobs. Whereas, The Only Way is Essex (<b>TOWIE</b>) cast are known for their heavy make-up, surgically enhanced bodies and “vajazzles”. While the Geordie Shore (<b>GS</b>) cast are known for their regular brawls, outrageous partying and “scouse brows”.</p><p>Do viewers of the popular reality TV programmes reflect the cast members and their stereotypes?</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Reality20image2.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>All three reality programmes feature alcohol and going out heavily. This is reflected in the viewers from each programme; they all show significantly higher preferences for visiting pubs and clubs than the national average. Out of the three programmes, GS viewers have the highest preference for pubs and clubs.</p><p>MIC portrays its cast as having a keen interest in health and fitness, whereas TOWIE and GS cast members seem less concerned by what they eat, or the amount of physical activity they do. Again, this is reflected among some viewers; more than double the amount of MIC viewers have gym memberships compared to TOWIE viewers.</p><p>The programmes all centre around a complex web of friendships and romantic relationships. MIC and GS viewers both value their friendship groups as an important part of their lives, significantly more than the national average.</p><p>It turns out, viewers do reflect the cast members from the reality programmes that they watch. MIC viewers tend to be health conscious, sociable and perceive themselves as sophisticated. GS viewers are risk takers, love going out to clubs and trendy bars and survive on little sleep. Lastly, TOWIE viewers tend to have lots of free time, which they like to fill with shopping and make-up.</p><p>Do you reflect characters from the TV shows you watch?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6aqa2hk6GytHuQb21sal2nsqK4yK2wZquYpMRuvsSfo56bpJ68r7%2BMmqmeZaaesrix0axkrKGdnrmivoytn56hog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
