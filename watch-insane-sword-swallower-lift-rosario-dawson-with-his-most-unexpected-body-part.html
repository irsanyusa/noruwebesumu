Check out his dangerous performance in the video below, and read on to find out how the judges reacted to the wild audition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sword-swallower-lifts-rosario-dawson>Sword Swallower Lifts Rosario Dawson</h2><p>Andrew asked for a volunteer from the judges’ panel to help him with his routine. None of the other judges wanted to do it, so Snoop Dogg volunteered Rosario Dawson. Andrew proceeded to tie her legs with rope.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href=#>WHO ARE THE ‘GO-BIG SHOW’ JUDGES? MEET THEM ALL</a></p><p>Snoop Dogg remarked that it looked like she was going to get run over by train. Instead, Andrew had Rosario lie down on a mat while he attached a chain to her waist. He then stuck a sword down his throat before lifting Rosario up.</p><p>But Andrew didn’t lift her using his arms. Instead, he balanced hooks on his face, just under his eyes. The judges, including Rosario, were totally freaked out by the performance. “Is it over?” Snoop asked, looking like he was going to throw up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-andrew-make-it-on-go-big-show>Did Andrew Make It On ‘Go-Big Show’?</h3><p>After the performance, Snoop Dogg said it was “hard to watch” and then it was “hard&nbsp;not&nbsp;to watch.” Andrew was up against a magician named Scott Anderson. The judges gave both of them a score of 95.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘GO-BIG SHOW’ PREMIERE: WITNESS THE ‘MOST EXTREME TALENT SHOW EVER’</a></strong></p><p>In order to break the tie, host Bert Kreischer flipped a coin. Andrew won, meaning he got to move on to the semifinals. We’ll see him again when the next round of the competition rolls around.</p><p>Andrew holds a couple of world records, including one for most weight pulled with the eye sockets. (Check out the video above to see him pull a car the same way he lifted Rosario.) He also holds the record for “longest piece of metal to pass through the nose and mouth.”</p><p>It’s safe to say that Andrew has a lot more up his sleeve for when he returns to the show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Miley-Cyrus-The-Voice-Miley-Sexy-Outfits-Miley-Super-Bowl-Performance.jpeg alt="Miley Cyrus Flaunts Sexiest Fashion Looks Ever Ahead Of Big Super Bowl Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Go-Big Show</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Rosario Dawson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571pqrnKBdnru0rc2eZKyvn6exbr%2FWmqOlp6eav264yJ%2BrZqqfqK6ztc5mm5qvo6S7bsPIrZ9moJmoeq670q1krqaVrb2mr9Oem2aan5nGbrzAq6to</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
