It&nbsp;may still be&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;big taboo in&nbsp;the parenting handbook, but favoritism is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reality that many folks deal with. And according to&nbsp;specialists, parents who have a&nbsp;preferred kid don’t need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;guilt trip just yet. Because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not all bad&nbsp;— if&nbsp;handled properly, that&nbsp;is.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>summarized important points from experts that explain why it’s okay to&nbsp;like your kids differently. We&nbsp;also prepared tips that could help you manage your children’s perceptions.</p><p><h2>Having more fondness for one kid is&nbsp;completely normal, and admitting it&nbsp;can help you become a&nbsp;better parent.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/28b/79d/8ca2e65beab90a90f8c81be850.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;completely possible to&nbsp;feel a&nbsp;stronger bond with just one child, especially if&nbsp;he&nbsp;or&nbsp;she has more similarities with you. As&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>therapist</a> puts&nbsp;it, “Parents are humans,” and <a href=# title=psychologically data-link=tag>psychologically</a> speaking,<strong> </strong>it’s normal to&nbsp;be&nbsp;drawn to&nbsp;people who affirm&nbsp;us.</p><p>And<strong> the sooner you recognize your personal biases, the sooner you can be&nbsp;mindful of&nbsp;how you treat your youngsters.</strong> Keeping your preferences in&nbsp;check can improve your parenting relationship and help foster a&nbsp;healthier family <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>environment</a>.</p><p><h2>There are many valid reasons why you connect with your kids differently.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39b/bba/2961a75783b4b24e97458e0cb1.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the reasons is&nbsp;because that child shares more of&nbsp;your <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>personality</a> and is&nbsp;mirroring your traits back at&nbsp;you. <strong>It&nbsp;could also be&nbsp;a&nbsp;seasonal fondness, depending on&nbsp;who behaves better.</strong> For example, one mom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “Right now, my&nbsp;8-year-old son is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little know-it-all... Frankly, it’s irritating. In&nbsp;contrast, my&nbsp;5-year-old daughter is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very cute, snuggly stage in&nbsp;life. She is&nbsp;melting my&nbsp;heart every day.”</p><p>Another factor that could affect your relationship with your kid is&nbsp;your own childhood experiences. Maybe he&nbsp;or&nbsp;she reminds you of&nbsp;someone that made you feel either positive or&nbsp;negative emotions. If&nbsp;it’s more on&nbsp;the bad side, professionals suggest treating your child as&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate individual, without the weight of&nbsp;your past experiences.</p><p><h2>Parents may feel happier and healthier when they spend more time with the dearest offspring.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aaa/a5f/b80d98517e9072c2952e83ef25.jpg><p>Knowing who the mother or&nbsp;father is&nbsp;closest to&nbsp;can have an&nbsp;impact on&nbsp;the quality of&nbsp;their care as&nbsp;they get older. One <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> found that <strong>elderly mothers recover faster from an&nbsp;emergency and experience better <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a></strong> if&nbsp;it’s their favorite child that tends to&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>Even if&nbsp;parents do&nbsp;not acknowledge&nbsp;it, children can feel if&nbsp;there’s favoritism in&nbsp;the family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42a/41f/74c0cc5ed08347d5feee539808.jpg><p>Instead of&nbsp;sweeping your feelings under the rug, it’s better to&nbsp;deal with them because your kids can perceive them. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>survey</a>, <strong>34% of&nbsp;the child respondents felt that there was a&nbsp;frontrunner in&nbsp;their parents’ hearts</strong>. In&nbsp;most cases, they also guessed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrong</a>, assuming that the most successful brother or&nbsp;sister was the top pick. But according to&nbsp;the poll, parents usually preferred the youngest kiddo.</p><p>This could be&nbsp;because they already had child-rearing experiences and are now more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confident</a> and at&nbsp;ease with the “baby” of&nbsp;the family. Experts also said that in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;birth <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>order</a>, <strong>the eldest is&nbsp;the spawn who gets the most privileges, while the youngest receives the most affection</strong>. The middle children don’t usually get the chance to&nbsp;have their parents all to&nbsp;themselves.</p><p><h2>Despite the varying relationships you may have with your kids, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;treat them equally.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/669/bc1/cf373e57438c05b8239c573b57.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;clinical psychologist, if&nbsp;kids grow up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;environment where they are often treated <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unfairly</a>, it&nbsp;will affect the child’s sense of&nbsp;worth. As&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible, <strong>parents should make an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;avoid discriminatory behavior</strong>. One way for folks to&nbsp;appear neutral is&nbsp;to&nbsp;settle <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disputes</a> impartially. Avoid taking a&nbsp;side and guide your children into resolving the issue among themselves.</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also worth mentioning that in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>survey</a>, 52%-62% of&nbsp;the kids said that <strong>favoritism</strong> <strong>didn’t necessarily lead to&nbsp;any long-lasting damage in&nbsp;their relationships.</strong></p><h2>Bonus: Here are some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tips</a> that can help you manage your children’s perceptions.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40e/ea7/94d4e0599d8827d769be4c7147.jpg><ul readability=2><li readability=7><strong>If&nbsp;your kid accuses you of&nbsp;playing favorites, validate his or&nbsp;her feelings and address the issue directly.</strong><p>Instead of&nbsp;dismissing them, empathize by&nbsp;saying, “I&nbsp;know you feel upset that you think your sister is&nbsp;the favorite, I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;too.” Then explain the situation by&nbsp;laying down facts and reasons why you get along better with his or&nbsp;her sibling. For example, “Your sister and&nbsp;I have personalities that match, but that doesn’t mean that&nbsp;I don’t love you.” You can also state the sibling’s good habits that helped them earn brownie points.</p></li></ul><ul readability=1><li readability=5><strong>Give equal praises and punishments, and let them know that you love them all.</strong><p>Whenever you commend them for a&nbsp;job well done, try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;specific as&nbsp;possible. Instead of&nbsp;“Good job,” say “It&nbsp;was nice of&nbsp;you to&nbsp;help out that old lady.” In&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;punishment, try to&nbsp;reflect if&nbsp;you are making exceptions for one child. Then come up&nbsp;with consequences that are age-appropriate as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;being fair.</p></li></ul><ul readability=0><li readability=3><strong>Avoid comparing your children or&nbsp;singling out one of&nbsp;the siblings.</strong><p>Try not to&nbsp;say things like, “You should behave more like your brother,” or&nbsp;point out the flaws of&nbsp;one child in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the other. Pitting your kids against each other may result in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unhealthy dynamic between them.</p></li></ul><ul readability=0.5><li readability=4><strong>If&nbsp;you feel that the situation is&nbsp;affecting your family’s relationship and mental health, seek help from a&nbsp;professional.</strong><p>Unresolved issues may affect your children negatively, and it&nbsp;could spill over into their adulthood. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you find yourself or&nbsp;your partner struggling with favoritism, or&nbsp;if&nbsp;you are unable to&nbsp;handle things fairly, consider seeing a&nbsp;family therapist.</p></li></ul><p>Do&nbsp;you think favoritism exists in&nbsp;most families?
