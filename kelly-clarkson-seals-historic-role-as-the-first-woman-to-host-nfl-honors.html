Amazingly, this will mark history for the Emmy and Grammy-Award winning artist as she becomes the first ever woman to lead the groundbreaking event.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-set-to-lead-the-2023-nfl-honors-as-host>Kelly Clarkson Set to Lead the 2023 NFL Honors as Host</h2><p>NFL Honors is a prime-time awards special meant to recognize National Football League’s best players, performances, and plays from season 2022. Since its inception in 2012, NFL Honors has always had male hosts in each ceremony. These hosts include Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Harvey, Alec Baldwin, Seth Meyers, Rob Riggle and Conan O’Brien.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> will however break that streak, serving as host for the football field this year. She revealed the great news back in December 2022 on Instagram, much to the surprise of her avid fans.</p><p>“Y’all! I ‘m so excited to announce that I’ll be hosting the 2023 NFL Honors!” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> wrote. “I can’t wait to celebrate all of the best players and moments from the NFL season.”</p><p>Presented by Invisalign, the ceremony will happen on Thursday, February 9 at Symphony Hall in Phoenix, Arizona. Furthermore, NFL Honors will air LIVE at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT on NBC, NFL Network and Peacock.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Had “Mixed Feelings” Before Accepting the Role</h2><p>Speaking to Access Daily, Clarkson confessed that she felt a bit confused why she got the hosting role offer. The “Breakaway” singer is apparently self-aware of her &nbsp;little to zero knowledge about football, thus the initial jitters.</p><p>“I had mixed feelings,” she said. “I was like, ‘Now, wait, I’m not involved in sports ball whatsoever.’ Shouldn’t you ask someone who’s involved in the sports community?”</p><p>Fortunately, Clarkson has gotten over her doubts, then accepting the job. Indeed, despite having meager understanding about the sport, the pop star will make a great host. Clarkson has a number of experience when it comes to hosting. The Kelly Clarkson Show is currently airing its fourth season in NBC. In 2022, she hosted American Song Contest with Snoop Dogg. She’s also become a recurrent coach on The Voice, coming back for the upcoming season with new coaches Niall Horan and Chance the Rapper and retiring coach <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton.</a></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_TrishStratus_viaIG-220x147.jpg alt="‘CGT’ Judge Trish Stratus Canceled Her WrestleCon Appearance, Tends to Her Daughter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlo5qurb%2BMoaCsrJ%2BntqR50aijnmWRqHq1tMRmnaKqo6l6uLvMmqVmrJ9itbC%2F02aln6Rdnbyvu9GsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
