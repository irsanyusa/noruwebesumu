The skeleton had been in&nbsp;the frozen ice for millions of&nbsp;years. It&nbsp;took experts decades to&nbsp;work out the species of&nbsp;this strange fossil. It&nbsp;was identified as&nbsp;a&nbsp;new genus of&nbsp;pterosaur.</p><p>Pterosaurs were massive flying reptiles with wingspans of&nbsp;over 16&nbsp;feet. Their heads were 3.5 times the size of&nbsp;their bodies. Pterosaurs lived 76&nbsp;million years ago when they soared above the dinosaurs. Scientists described them as&nbsp;the “biggest, meanest, and most bizarre animals that ever flew.” The new genus has been named Cryodrakon Boreas, which translates to&nbsp;“frozen dragon of&nbsp;the north winds.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/48d/450/f676655b0d855bfaba634a4cc9.png><p>In&nbsp;2013, a&nbsp;young mountaineer was climbing one of&nbsp;the tallest mountains in&nbsp;Western Europe, Mont Blanc. He&nbsp;noticed a&nbsp;strange metal box poking out of&nbsp;the snow. The mountaineer pried the box open and found that it&nbsp;was filled with precious rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. The climber immediately handed the box to&nbsp;the authorities.</p><p>It&nbsp;was discovered that the box likely belonged to&nbsp;a&nbsp;passenger on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;two flights from <a href=# title=India data-link=tag>India</a> that crashed into the mountain over 50&nbsp;years ago. The box was valued to&nbsp;be&nbsp;worth over $200,000, and authorities are still searching for the heir to&nbsp;the small box of&nbsp;treasures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/920/5c6/6d1fa858a882d93afe2e279dc4.png><p>In&nbsp;northwest Siberia in&nbsp;2007, a&nbsp;reindeer herder was on&nbsp;an&nbsp;outing with his sons when he&nbsp;noticed something strange in&nbsp;the ice. The man realized it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;frozen Mammoth calf and immediately contacted the local museum. The calf was named Lyuba and was the best-preserved mammoth mummy in&nbsp;the world at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;its discovery.</p><p>Lyuba had been in&nbsp;the ice for 41,800 years and is&nbsp;around 30–35 days old. From trunk to&nbsp;tail, the mammoth calf is&nbsp;roughly the same size as&nbsp;a&nbsp;large calf. If&nbsp;you’re interested in&nbsp;seeing for yourself, Lyuba travels to&nbsp;museums all around the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a37/632/7a77f7559a91985a53e39a6ade.png><p>On&nbsp;the frozen continent of&nbsp;Antarctica, covered in&nbsp;layers of&nbsp;ice and snow, is&nbsp;Mount Erebus&nbsp;— the frozen volcano. The volcano was discovered in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eruption in&nbsp;1841 by&nbsp;explorers on&nbsp;an&nbsp;arctic expedition. The volcano is&nbsp;over 12,000&nbsp;ft tall [(3657&nbsp;m)] and has been active for the last 1.3 million years.</p><p>Deep within the middle of&nbsp;the volcano is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge crater filled with large volumes of&nbsp;molten lava. The volcano has occasional explosions, which means it&nbsp;is&nbsp;classified as&nbsp;being in&nbsp;continuing eruption. However, these eruptions are nothing to&nbsp;worry about because they are generally rather small.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/11f/bed/3774c9586583d1659b1ce59c05.png><p>Back in&nbsp;1991, two hikers were traveling across the Italian Alps when they stumbled across a&nbsp;body that they presumed to&nbsp;belong to&nbsp;a&nbsp;recently lost hiker. The duo trudged back down the mountain to&nbsp;report their unfortunate findings. Once the remains were recovered, it&nbsp;was clear that the body was not recent at&nbsp;all. Scientists determined that the iceman was more than 5,000 years old and named him Otzi.</p><p>The discovery was unlike anything scientists had ever seen before because the body was so&nbsp;well-preserved. For years, Otzi was studied by&nbsp;scientists who discovered that our ancestors have a&nbsp;lot more in&nbsp;common with&nbsp;us than we&nbsp;ever knew before. Otzi was covered in&nbsp;ink body art. Research done on&nbsp;the contents of&nbsp;his stomach revealed that his last meal was dry-cured meat, similar to&nbsp;the bacon we&nbsp;eat today. Otzi has at&nbsp;least 19&nbsp;relatives living today, somewhere in&nbsp;Central Europe.</p><p>Scientists were researching ancient squirrel burrows in&nbsp;Siberia when they came across something interesting. One of&nbsp;the squirrels had hidden away precious seeds deep beneath the ground. The seeds had been encased in&nbsp;ice for 32,000&nbsp;years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dce/b7f/f3548d54d5ae43bc214975d796.png><p>The seeds were for the flower Silene stenophylla, which had long since gone extinct. Amazingly, scientists were able to&nbsp;recover plant tissue from inside the seeds and grow an&nbsp;entire crop of&nbsp;flowers. They’ve since reintroduced the previously extinct flower to&nbsp;natural habitats all across the world.</p><p>In&nbsp;1930, a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;Norwegian scientists sailed around the Arctic Ocean, conducting research on&nbsp;the Seas and Glaciers. They reached White Island, a&nbsp;dangerous and icy land no&nbsp;human had set foot on&nbsp;before. Or&nbsp;so&nbsp;they thought. The scientists were shocked to&nbsp;discover the tip of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small boat sticking out of&nbsp;the snow. Frozen inside the boat, they found scientific equipment and various personal items, including a&nbsp;jacket monogrammed “S.A. Andrée”. They had discovered the wreck of&nbsp;the famous Andrée Arctic Balloon Expedition.</p><p>In&nbsp;1897 Swedish explorers, led by&nbsp;Andrée attempted to&nbsp;travel to&nbsp;the North Pole by&nbsp;hydrogen balloon. No&nbsp;one has ever heard from them ever again. People only found out what happened to&nbsp;them when the wreck was discovered 33&nbsp;years later. It&nbsp;turns out that the balloon had crashed on&nbsp;White Island only two days after departing from Sweden. The explorers traveled along the island on&nbsp;a&nbsp;small makeshift boat but were unable to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;any further.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e2d/345/ec6f6b560a85358a15a1deac61.png><p>The best-preserved wooly mammoth ever found was discovered in&nbsp;an&nbsp;area of&nbsp;permafrost in&nbsp;Siberia in&nbsp;2010. Scientists named the frozen mammoth Yuka after the small village near where it&nbsp;was found. Yuka had been frozen for 39,000 years and is&nbsp;thought to&nbsp;have been around 6–8 years old. Because Yuka is&nbsp;so&nbsp;well-preserved, it&nbsp;has been studied for years and provided new information about Mammoths. In&nbsp;2019, scientists reported that they were able to&nbsp;activate cells taken from Yuka’s tissue. Maybe one day we’ll have wooly mammoths roaming the land.</p><p>From looking at&nbsp;pictures and videos of&nbsp;Antarctica, the continent appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;freezing cold, covered in&nbsp;snow, and flat except for a&nbsp;few small hills. Scientists believed that too. When studying the Gamburtsev Mountains in&nbsp;the early 2000s, they were shocked to&nbsp;discover that the small rocky hills were actually the peak of&nbsp;a&nbsp;gigantic mountain formation under a&nbsp;mile of&nbsp;snow. Using radar technology, researchers worked out that the mountains are really around 10,000 feet tall and sprawl across 750&nbsp;miles. This is&nbsp;around the same size as&nbsp;the European Alps, except hidden under tons of&nbsp;ice and snow.</p><p>At&nbsp;a&nbsp;gold mine in&nbsp;Siberia, a&nbsp;businessman was examining a&nbsp;nearby river when he&nbsp;noticed something interesting in&nbsp;the frost. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;small wooly rhino calf that was later named Sasha. The wooly rhino has been extinct for 15,000&nbsp;years. It’s thought that Sasha could’ve been frozen in&nbsp;the ice for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;39,000&nbsp;years. Sasha is&nbsp;unique because it’s the only full-body wooly rhino to&nbsp;have ever been discovered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/106/e87/f3e4c45127bd1cf42b6ebaca30.png><p>Glaciers around the Northern Italian town of&nbsp;Pelo have begun to&nbsp;melt. Artifacts from decades and even centuries ago have been discovered pouring out of&nbsp;the ice. Personal belongings from soldiers have been found, things like diaries, photographs, and even love letters. Historians have even uncovered an&nbsp;entire cabin preserved beneath the ice. The cabin was filled with hard metal helmets and clothes.</p><p>In&nbsp;1845 Sir John Franklin embarked on&nbsp;an&nbsp;ill-fated expedition to&nbsp;the North Pole. The crew traveled on&nbsp;two ships, H.M.S. Erebus and the ironically named H.M.S. Terror. The expedition met with disaster, and both ships were lost to&nbsp;the icy waters.</p><p>In&nbsp;2016, the H.M.S. Terror was discovered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;researchers. Despite being lost for 170&nbsp;years, the freezing cold waters had maintained the ship in&nbsp;pristine condition. Scientists described the ship as&nbsp;“frozen in&nbsp;time.” Dinner plates and glasses were still on&nbsp;shelves, beds and desks were still in&nbsp;order, and even the passenger’s luggage appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;good condition. The H.M.S. Erebus was also discovered nearby, but due to&nbsp;changing water conditions, the ship wasn’t in&nbsp;great shape.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8d7/5e9/75f4ae5815992d885d4f746d12.png><p>The glacial ice surrounding a&nbsp;mountain passageway in&nbsp;Norway that was notoriously used by&nbsp;the Vikings has revealed hundreds of&nbsp;ancient artifacts. One of&nbsp;these artifacts was a&nbsp;giant unopened wooden box that was welded together. Researchers were beside themselves with anticipation, waiting to&nbsp;open this box. They believed it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;filled with Viking treasures or&nbsp;artifacts that would give&nbsp;us an&nbsp;insight into ancient society. When they opened the box, all that was inside was a&nbsp;plain old beeswax candle.</p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that this box wasn’t actually as&nbsp;old as&nbsp;they thought it&nbsp;was. By&nbsp;analyzing the candle, they discovered that the box dates back to&nbsp;the 17th century. The age of&nbsp;the Vikings had ended by&nbsp;the 11th century. It’s likely that the candle box belonged to&nbsp;a&nbsp;farmer who was shipping it&nbsp;from his summer farm to&nbsp;his winter farm to&nbsp;light up&nbsp;the long nights.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLOzu9mepWacopa0sLqMrKeem5mawG7DwKxkraqRpb2msIyipWahk5p6p7vRZm5vZZ2hu27FxJqprGVoZoB6fpho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
