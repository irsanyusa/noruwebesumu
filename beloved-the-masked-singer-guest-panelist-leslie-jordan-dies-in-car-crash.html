The world has definitely lost a light in the entertainment industry today.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-leslie-jordan-dies-in-car-crash>Leslie Jordan Dies in Car Crash</h2><p>On Monday, October 24, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> reported that Leslie Jordan passed away while driving. The outlet revealed that he “suffered some sort of medical emergency and crashed his BMW into the side of a building.” Other details have yet to be revealed at this time.</p><p>Following the news of Jordan’s passing, the comedian’s team published a statement on his social media accounts.</p><p>“The love and light that Leslie shared will never go out and we invite you to share your memories and comfort each other during this time. In the coming days we will be giving a glimpse of a project Leslie was really proud of and was looking forward to sharing with the world,” they wrote.</p><p>It was announced this past March that Jordan was set to take The Masked Singer panel once again alongside Robin Thicke, Ken Jeong, Jenny McCarthy, and Nicole Scherzinger.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will He Still Appear on The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Jordan’s guest appearance has yet to air on this season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a>. Fans believe that he will be apart of the show’s upcoming comedy night. Perhaps the original humor-filled episode will be modified as a tribute for the recurring guest panelist.</p><p>This past September, Jordan appeared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Jennifer Hudson Show</a> to talk about his upcoming The Masked Singer appearance. It’s clear that the comedian loved being apart of the series, since he immediately covered his mouth (thinking he spoiled something) after saying that he’s only guessed Dog the Bounty Hunter correctly on the series.</p><p>For those who may not remember, Jordan sat on the panel on both seasons six and seven. The comedian even played a prank on the other panelists, by getting “unmasked” as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Soft Serve</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Aside from The Masked Singer, Jordan was known for his roles on Will & Grace, Hearts Afire, The Cool Kids, Call me Kat, and American Horror Story. He also was a guest judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race, and appeared on Celebrity Big Brother.</p><p>Outside of his TV and Movie career, Jordan earned even more fame during the pandemic. At the time, he posted funny videos on Instagram that represented himself as a “silly, funny, goofy, happy-go-lucky senior citizen.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_LindsayArnold_SamuelCusick_viaIG_PhotobyDylanKelseyBitton.png alt="‘DWTS’ Pro Lindsay Arnold Is Pregnant with Her Second Child" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wZ6jqK6VmXq1tMRmpJqrm5qxbr%2FIp56eql2cwqa%2F02anmqaVoba0wIylnKykmZp6q7vRnZinZZSesrR5yKdknJmiYrCzrdKhZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
