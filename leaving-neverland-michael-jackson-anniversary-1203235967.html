Surely interest would be high, given the King of Pop’s musical legacy and the circumstances of his untimely demise.</p><p>Big Fish optioned the 2012 book “Untouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death of Michael Jackson,” by Rolling Stone contributor Randall Sullivan, with an eye toward developing an unscripted series. The company, eager to expand into the scripted business, also found writers to develop a version of the book’s narrative as a limited series.</p><p>“We worked closely with Randall to identify material and footage and stories that people have never heard,” Big Fish president Dan Cesareo said. “People willing to go on record who hadn’t previously gone on record. We felt we had put together a really compelling narrative that would make a lot of sense for the market.”</p><h2 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-padding-t-075 lrv-u-padding-b-050 lrv-a-font-secondary-l u-color-black">Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/featured_4k_8k_v2.jpg alt='A tv with "4k" and "8k" on the screen.' height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="c-span lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase u-font-family-basic lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-padding-b-075 lrv-u-font-size-12 u-font-size-13@tablet u-color-brand-vip-primary"><a href=# class="c-span__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">VIP+</a></span><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">High-Resolution 8K Has Its Places, but TV Might Not Be One of Them</a></h3><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Yuvraj-Singh-Bhushan-Kumar-Ravi-Bhagchandka.jpg alt="Yuvraj Singh Bhushan Kumar Ravi Bhagchandka" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">Cancer-Surviving Cricket Star Yuvraj Singh Biopic Set at India's T-Series (EXCLUSIVE)</a></h3><p>Big Fish soon found a network partner, which Cesareo declined to name, and kicked development into high gear. But then came “<a href=# id=auto-tag_leaving-neverland_1 data-tag=leaving-neverland>Leaving Neverland</a>.”</p><h3>Popular on Variety</h3><p>The HBO documentary, which first screened at the Sundance Festival in January, forced networks and producers to rethink their plans on how to observe the anniversary of Jackson’s death — or whether to do so at all.</p><p>Directed by Dan Reed, “Leaving Neverland” centers on two accusers, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, now in their 30s, who recount in graphic detail how they were sexually abused by Jackson starting at very young ages. The two-part, four-hour documentary aired in March. Since then, many radio stations and DJs have stopped playing Jackson’s music, and the debate continues over how (or if) to separate the art from the artist.</p><p>In the case of “Untouchable,” Cesareo said the impact of the HBO doc was immediate. The network that had been developing the unscripted project with Big Fish? “They suddenly cut bait and ran,” he said. “The project was essentially toxic. That’s the feeling I got. No one wanted to touch it.”</p><p>Ditto the scripted version. “When ‘Leaving Neverland’ dropped at Sundance, we could barely get a return phone call,” he added.</p><p>But that’s not the only Michael Jackson-related project, timed to the anniversary of his death, that was scrubbed after “Leaving Neverland” came out. According to one insider, producers Scooter Braun and Den of Thieves had put together a plan to re-create Jackson’s “This Is It” concert — the one the singer had been planning and about to launch in London, just before his 2009 death — as a major TV special.</p><p>The idea would be to bring back the original dancers and musicians who had been a part of “This Is It,” along with a rotating cast of A-list guest stars sitting in individually, per song, for Jackson. The project didn’t get beyond the early pitch stage, however, before “Leaving Neverland” changed the tenor of the conversation about Jackson in popular culture.</p><p>“They went radio silent shortly thereafter,” one source said.</p><p>Programmers rarely let a major anniversary go unnoticed without some opportunity to target audience nostalgia. This summer, countless specials and documentaries (including one by Big Fish) will recount the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Apollo Moon landing. ABC News recently ran a two-hour primetime special about Farrah Fawcett, who died on June 25, 2009 — the same day as Jackson.</p><p>But ABC News isn’t planning any similar type of special about the singer. NBC and CBS also don’t appear to have anything in the works. As a matter of fact, it appears the only new Jackson special scheduled anywhere is ReelzChannel’s “The Michael Jackson Story,” set to air on June 23.</p><p>“In this moment and time, people want to keep a little bit of a distance from this and see if anything else plays out,” said one network exec. “For the time being, it’s radioactive in today’s world. People are having a hard time separating the human from the human artist. This puts people in a place where they do not want to be associated for the time being with this brand.”</p><p>The Michael Jackson estate is also taking a quiet approach to the anniversary of the singer’s death, but it said that’s by design. “We have never encouraged ‘celebrations’ on Michael’s death anniversary and don’t do events or shows ourselves,” an estate spokesperson wrote via email. “We suggest things to fans to honor his life — and this year we ask fans to pay tribute to his memory and philanthropic work by their performing an act of charity or kindness and posting it to their Instagram or Twitter accounts.</p><p>“When it comes to large celebrations, those are done around positive moments like his birthday,” they added.</p><p>But the estate had been planning on launching something in time for the anniversary: It and Columbia Live Stage were originally set to launch the Jackson-themed musical “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough” in Chicago later this year. Its cancelation was blamed on a labor dispute, and so far plans continue for the musical’s premiere on Broadway in the summer of 2020. But nonetheless, the Jackson estate has been remarkably quiet in recent months, after its attempts to discredit “Leaving Neverland” didn’t curtail the film’s impact.</p><p>“‘Leaving Neverland’ is reconceptualizing [Jackson’s] life and his personal life but also his work,” said Dan Reed, the filmmaker behind the documentary. “Because of that, it may have an impact on the way that people mourn his passing. I don’t want to take a position where it’s wrong not to celebrate his life, that’s an individual choice. Obviously he was a dad, he was a son. But I think ‘Leaving Neverland’ blew a hole in Michael Jackson’s personal reputation. Of course that’s going to impact the anniversary of his death, which would be planned as a celebration of his life and his work.</p><p>“I don’t want to say to people don’t make a big deal about the anniversary of his death,” Reed added. “But let’s just confront the fact that as an entertainer he was amazing, but as a man there were facets to his life that were really unacceptable.”</p><p>Reed suggested an alternate way to mark the anniversary of Jackson’s death: To take a stand against the sexual exploitation of children, both in Hollywood and in other parts of society.</p><p>“I welcome the opportunity at the tenth anniversary for people to contemplate very seriously how prevalent child sexual abuse is and how easily children can fall prey to beloved, charismatic and much admired and respected figures in the community,” Reed said. ” It’s a horrible thing that happens all over the world, it’s not just famous people. We need to wake up to how easy it is for us to be lulled into a false sense of security. If that’s what we take away from ‘Leaving Neverland,’ then great.”</p><p>Reed said he has been heartened by the impact that “Leaving Neverland” has had in pop culture, and noted that the timing (post Time’s Up and #MeToo) helped it and another documentary series, Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly,” in keeping the allegations of child abuse by those two entertainers in the news.</p><p>“Any kind of sexual abuse is a topic that people don’t want to talk about,” he said. “I think the Me Too movement and the R. Kelly documentary, they opened people’s minds to the fact that victims out there might be telling the truth. Sexual abuse is a crime that often has no witnesses and often has no material evidence to support it… I think [these things] opened people’s minds that they happen often.”</p><p>And because “Leaving Neverland” was so thorough in telling the horrifying stories of Jackson victims Robson and Safechuck, it doesn’t seem complete for any other production about Jackson to move forward without including those two or heavily recounting the doc’s findings. That’s also why, besides not wanting to touch this “radioactive” topic, producers might not want to try and top what Reed has just done. Whether producers or viewers will ever again want to watch a program that celebrates Jackson’s music remains to be seen — and is likely very much down the road.</p><p>“There was a [10th anniversary] special already, and it was called ‘Leaving Neverland’ on HBO,” said one reality producer. “It stole the conversation for a while. Right now, people are in contemplative mode. I think maybe for his 20th anniversary people will consider doing a [Jackson] music special. After the dust settles a little bit, people might be able to separate the music from the individual.”</p><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap lrv-a-font-primary-s o-nav__title a-content-ignore lrv-u-margin-r-050">Read More About:</h4><ul class="o-nav__list lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-a-font-secondary-regular-s" aria-labelledby><li class="o-nav__list-item lrv-u-margin-l-00 lrv-u-display-inline u-line-height-inherit-important"><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-a-font-secondary-regular-s u-vertical-align-top" href=#>Leaving Neverland,</a></li><li class="o-nav__list-item lrv-u-margin-l-00 lrv-u-display-inline u-line-height-inherit-important"><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-a-font-secondary-regular-s u-vertical-align-top" href=#>Michael Jackson</a></li></ul><a class="c-link lrv-u-cursor-pointer lrv-a-font-primary-xs u-color-black lrv-u-text-transform-capitalize lrv-a-icon-after a-icon-long-down-arrow-black a-icon-medium-grey:hover u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-u-display-flex lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-justify-content-center a-content-ignore" href=#>Jump to Comments</a><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-text-align-center@mobile-max lrv-u-padding-t-075 lrv-u-padding-b-075 lrv-a-font-secondary-l u-color-black">More from Variety</h2><ul class="lrv-a-grid lrv-a-cols2@tablet lrv-a-cols3@desktop lrv-u-align-items-stretch u-column-gap-050-important // lrv-a-unstyle-list"><li class="lrv-u-border-b-1 u-border-color-light-grey-tint-two"><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/featured_box_office_rebound.jpg alt="Deadpool, the minions, and Glen Powell posing" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 id=c-title-reality-check-summer-wont-save-box-office-deadpool-inside-out-twisters-1236092134 class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link">Reality Check: Summer Hot Streak Won’t Dig U.S. Box Office Out of Deep Hole in 2024</a></h3><ul class="lrv-u-flex lrv-u-order-n1 lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 u-letter-spacing-012 // lrv-u-margin-b-00"></ul><ul class="lrv-a-unstyle-list // lrv-u-font-size-12 lrv-u-font-family-primary lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black"></ul></li><li class="lrv-u-border-b-1 u-border-color-light-grey-tint-two"><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/featured_video_game_layoffs.jpg alt="Exit sign on video game controller" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 id=c-title-bungie-layoffs-highlight-gaming-industry-issues-unions-sag-aftra-1236093560 class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link">Bungie Layoffs Highlight Post-M&A Issues for Gaming Industry as Its Unions React</a></h3><ul class="lrv-u-flex lrv-u-order-n1 lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 u-letter-spacing-012 // lrv-u-margin-b-00"></ul><ul class="lrv-a-unstyle-list // lrv-u-font-size-12 lrv-u-font-family-primary lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black"></ul></li></ul><h3 id=comments>138 responses to “How ‘Leaving Neverland’ Upended TV’s Michael Jackson Anniversary Plans”</h3><a href=#>Newer Comments »</a><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 parent" id=comment-6115458><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/738e44c82e3cc1e1ee1e44eed32ba4b9?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>See Me - Feel Me <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 7, 2019 at 12:16 pm</a><p>Sad to say but it seems pretty clear that Michael was a manipulative child molester who played the kids parents to make them feel comfortable that their boys would be safe with him. Jackson was a brilliant artist and a great performer but he was very troubled soul and a pedophile and there is really no way that any series would be taken seriously if it did not include that as a part of his story. Tragic to be sure but celebrating him, celebrates pedophilia and hopefully there will never be a time when that is okay, even in the America we live in now.</p><ul class=children><li class="comment odd alt depth-2 parent" id=comment-6115503><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cfd542f00e26b612ab0fd4e2e319d88e?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>GF <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 7, 2019 at 1:47 pm</a><p>False.

It’s dumb because the people that say he’s guilty are the ones that don’t do research but rather listen to a four hour mockumentary about men who tried to get rich from a $1.5BILLION lawsuit and failed. He has been dead for a decade coming up on June 25th, he has been cleared of all wrong doing. And if it were true what’s the point of bringing up this late for now? He obviously can’t be punished so they have to let his children suffer. Let him rest, he is innocent. They always want to do crap like this, they’re doing it to Michael Jackson and recently are trying to do shit like this to Martin Luther King Jr and he has been dead for over 50yrs.

I’m not even an MJ fan, but the “documentary” felt so manipulative and off to me, I immediately went online after and found out the truth, piece by piece. I cannot stand the injustice of it. They are clearly after money, appealing a 4-year-old $1.5 billion lawsuit they lost against the Estate, and they are after attention and relevance. Please, people, don’t be sheep! A good place to start would be the hashtag “IKnewLeavingNeverlandwasBS, which was TRENDING WORLDWIDE on Twitter last week. Hardly fits the narrative of this article, does it, that that hashtag was trending? Sure, there will be a few fanatics sprinkled in there, but that hashtag is full of reliable and convincing information. Also look up Taj and Brandi Jackson, who are clearly more honest and decent human beings than anyone involved with LN has ever been. They have been featured in several interviews and counter-videos to LN on YouTube, and those videos have everything you should need to know to at least harbor serious doubts about LN.</p><p>Side note, one of my biggest pet peeves lately is the frequent misuse of the term “victim blaming.” Victim blaming is saying, “Well, she wore a short skirt, so she was asking for it.” Defending someone who you believe is innocent is NOT that.</p><ul class=children><li class="comment even depth-2 parent" id=comment-6115543><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/797ba2c0136737128eb0b48bff0fc2b4?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Deena <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 7, 2019 at 2:44 pm</a><p>How do you explain the case of Jordy Chandler who was able to provide graphic detail of Jackson’s genitive, caused by his skin condition? Chandler was awarded a multi-million dollar settlement by Jackson. I remember reading the police reports in a Vanity Fair article and they were so gruesome they stick in my mind even today. Chandler virtually disappeared after the settlement, going so far as changing his identity to no longer be associated with Jackson. He certainly wasn’t in it for the publicity. How about the pornographic material that contained young boys that was taken from Jackson’s home? The old adage, “where there’s smoke there’s fire” seems appropriate. And there’s a whole lot of smoke.</p><ul class=children><li class="comment odd alt depth-3 parent" id=comment-6115554><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/32d7b0e3c38753f4b48a02794f96f7e7?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Dave Jordon <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 7, 2019 at 3:02 pm</a><p>@Deena “Chandler virtually disappeared after the settlement, going so far as changing his identity to no longer be associated with Jackson”</p><p>Look, you can look at it many ways…right? That the settlement was so much or indeed enough for Chandler to disappear and change his name. And if he wasn’t for the publicity then why did he sue a public musician in the first place? And in regarding child pornography found in his home? If MJ did indeed possess some he would have been arrested by now, wouldn’t he? I mean, when was this pornography found, was it after or before he was found died? You can look at it on so many ways, for if you are going to make accusations, users here want to see the proof.</p><ul class=children><li class="comment even depth-4 parent" id=comment-6115648><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a837e7582d1695450176252829978e6d?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Stacey Donald <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 7, 2019 at 6:59 pm</a><p>Jordan Chandler stated that he was NOT molested and that it was his stepfather’s idea to extort money from Michael Jackson.

It just shows they have only lies to defend their beloved King of Pedo. Delusional MJ fans are everywhere on social media attacking the victims, calling them liars, yet telling lies themselves. You are not helping CSA victims by shaming them into silence and telling them they won’t be believed unless they present forensic evidence (there usually isn’t any in CSA cases) or by normalising pedophile behaviour saying it’s perfectly fine for adult men to sleep alone in a bed with little boys. For those who claim it was all innocent and Jackson was some kind of asexual angel you need to know that police found and seized hardcore porn and child erotica in his bedroom. Child erotica are pictures of naked little boys flaunting their genitals. If found in the possession of a man accused of molesting children it is considered powerful corroborating evidence. These were entered as evidencevat the 2005 trial. Read the court transcripts, it’s all there.</p><ul class=children><li class="comment even depth-6" id=comment-6115764><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8e00292684e10f7bb77a58122892db12?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>SiGi <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 12:49 am</a><p>So you claim they found undeniable corroborating evidence, eventhough the court case ended early because of complete and utter lack of evidence and credible witnesses?</p></li><li class="comment odd alt depth-6" id=comment-6115912><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/96ba7a6381e637bb6eb0bca1a041e905?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Tico <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 1:11 pm</a><p>Yes, it is correct that Jordy didn’t come out and give a statement that Michael never touched him. The settlement most likely had a non disclosure clause barring him from speaking publicly. But privately is another story. Mesareau had witnesses ready to testify that he told them Michael never did anything inappropriate.</p><p>But… When the 2005 trial was underway, Jordy told the prosecutors he would legally fight any attempt to make him do testify. His Mother testified that she hadn’t talked to him in over 10 years. Evan Chandler beat the boy with a dumbbell and Jordan was emancipated from his parents. He most likely blames them for ruining his friendship with Michael.</p></li><li class="comment even depth-6" id=comment-6115927><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/96ba7a6381e637bb6eb0bca1a041e905?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Tico <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 1:47 pm</a><p>…oh, and those same books of naked boys can also be found in the U.S. Library of Congress.

But here’s what Tom Sneddon did…he handed one to Gavin Arviso and a juror spoke up and asked whether he should be wearing gloves. Tom then sent out the magazine for fingerprint analysis. That was an action many lawyers feel he should’ve been disbarred for by the way…</p><p>Tom Mesereau’s cross examination revealed Gavin was lying when he asked him if it was the magazine Michael showed him to which he replied YES. And then Mesereau revealed that the magazine’s print date was after the last time Gavin was actually at the ranch.</p><p>When Gavin and his brother were allowed to go to Neverland, Michael was barely there.

Use your common sense. If it did, Michael would have been arrested. He never was. And 2 grand juries refused to indict for lack of evidence. Wouldn’t such a match be the strongest evidence to at least bring about an indictment? Also, the 94 settlement, which you can easily read online for yourself, clearly states that it did not prevent Jordan or his family from testifying or cooperating further with the police investigation. Michael had to settle the CIVIL case to protect his defense from being exposed during the deposition. The settlement did not prevent the criminal investigation, which was also aided by the FBI. The Chandlers took the money and ran. IT was a clear case of extortion. And sadly, created the blueprint for future allegations.<br>As an adult, Jordan Chandler has told several people that he not molested, witnesses who were ready to be called during the 05 trial.</p><p>The “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” argument is silly and simplistic.

Jordan said MJ was circumcised. We know from Mr. Jackson’s autopsy report that he was not. Furthermore, MJ was combed through in five surprise raids in eleven years where every inch of where he resided was combed through, that includes his doctors offices where his medical records were illegally confiscated.</p><p>He was subjected through a painful strip search where all his intimate regions were full fully examined with over a hundred photos taken. Two grand juries in two different districts said flat out that there is zero evidence to indict and exonerated him. This after the rate of indictment being 99 percent. Also remember, Evan Chandler, Jordan’s father, is caught on tape admitting to extorting Jackson. It’s on YouTube.

There also were things that Michael’s own family and their associates wanted as well<br>It was a confluence of competing motivations beyond unethical and truly criminal attached to dollar signs trying to get the actual currency those signs represented. Not much has changed as far as what evils some people will do to try to get money. Mr. Messereau who represented Michael during a second batch of such attempts explained it succinctly and Michael was very justifiably exonerated. As far as Dan Reed and the 2 liars and their groupings at LN the lies have been revealed again. No train station when allegations were fictionalized to have occured, no singled out special relationships and very overt desires of stageparents and their kids to be the one shining protege which of course was also not in any manner the truth. There is no truth to the 7 year old mouth story which was inadvertently debunked both before and after that utterance by Wade’s own mother.<br>Safechuck had to change his original story about the Pepsi convention because it was proved that he did not have that kind of accesses to Michael nor Michael wanted that type of accesses to him. There could not have been any relieved dancing on the part of Safechuck’s mother as stated in the criminal pieve of fiction by Amos/ Reed and these families as per their own statements none of those family members including Safechuck’s mother knew of any allegations eminating from their adult children either when they were kids or as middle aged mem. Then there is also the change in attorneys that happened surrounding the further inconvenient lies of theirs Robson switching his story from repressed memories to “always remembered” and Safechuck statement that he refused to be a witness in 2005 when he was never asked and the judge ruled that he could not testify as he was an immaterial entity. Its not wizadry of smoke and mirrors ilk its criminality. My mother-in-law Katherine and I have long agreed that we do not want to celebrate the evil that befell Michael almost 10 years ago but I still see Jermaine and others trying to capitalize on it at Reelz and its not any better than what Amos Pictures LTD. tried and failed at LN. Through that criminal farce Reed is still trying to prop himself and his outfit up as some type of moderator but we all know there was nothing moderate, truth seeking or professionally undertaken in the piece of filth he brought to television screens. He went to a bunch of people who all lost their “case of a lifetime” scenarios and left them each with egg face. Now he tries to parse it as ” nevermind my tale got blown out of the water” as there is a larger conjecture than the big lies they have told about my husband and got shown out on by actual empirical facts there is this hypothesis about how lying about my husband Michael Joseph Jackson in attempts to embezzle 1.6 BILLION dollars served some other goal which still has to do with attempted disingenuous miseducation of the viewers as well as any that heard about the profusion of lies attached to those embezzlement schemes. As far as the comments of some of these pervs trying to portray themselves as advocates for those who have actually been abused its obvious in their public comments that they are the uncaring and abusive and that they front for Reed et al as a continuation of the type of salacious, malicious and patently false assertions that Reed has made in conjunction to his efforts to defend those liars that he chose to film with no validated checking of the BILLION SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR seeking bogus litigants statements.

Making ludicrous statements like There was no proof that MJ did anything. Cash settlements, multiple accusers, MJ spending hundreds of nights alone with CERTAIN children, Two children accurately describing markings on his genitals, Law enforcement, psychiatrists, therapists, social workers all stating the accusations are credible. There is more information in these cases than in many cases of child abuse and rape but the MJ Estate Bots still pretend it is all to be ignored, Taj Jackson’s Crowd Sourcing Campaign is no where near it’s goal with only about 4100 donors. The Mj Estate and The MJ family could easily afford the $777,000 price tag for the rebuttal documentary but they wont pay for it. U need to ask why? Why would Janet Jackson. the MJ Estate or The Jackson Family just pay for the documentary. The answer is fairly simple. If the family or estate put up the money than they would place themselves in a position to be sued for slander and at that point all the information they have been trying to bury would come forward. For people who want the ‘truth’ to come forward they are sure doing a great deal to stop any avenue for stories of James, Wade, etc to be tested. Don’t be fooled it is a small minority that refuses to see the obvious predatory nature of MJ and that minority is shrinking in numbers every day. #LeavingNeverland</p><ul class=children><li class="comment odd alt depth-2 parent" id=comment-6115762><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/82aeceb8bc2ec01199f4085f36627976?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><a href=# class=url rel="ugc external nofollow">Sugar Price</a> <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 12:44 am</a><p>My God AnnieMay…really???

As soon as this documentary came out everyone got on the bandwagon of cancelling Michael Jackson. They want to cancel someone who has been ACCUSED of crimes. Not once have they been proven yet people decided, after a stupid one sided documentary, that the victims were telling the truth. It’s mind boggling how ignorant people can be. I don’t understand how many times we have to see someone get falsely accused in this country to know that sometimes these so called “victims” aren’t victims at all. People are so on board of supporting the accuser and degrading the person being accused before proof is even given and it’s sick. That documentary was a slap in the face to all the people who have truly been abused in any form. People continue to say that Michael was guilty yet never can give any proof to back it up. They say such things like “he slept in beds with boys” as if that’s proof he molested children. They want to ignore the facts that Michael was never truly alone with those boys. There would be bodyguards, other adults and some of the children’s parents in the room with him or the fact that on MANY occasions, the documentary and the accusers have been caught lying! MANY TIMES! Actual proof, that they were lying!!! YET they never want to put that in the news because they want to erase him from history. Michael was a black man who was incredibly powerful and influential and society did not like that at all. It’s disgusting what they did to him while he was alive and it’s even more disgusting that they’re continuing to do these things years after he has died. This country is full of a bunch of followers who are too ignorant to do anything but follow what the media and society tells them to do. I will never respect someone who can condemn a person because of a rumor being spread without looking up all the facts before making their final decision on how they should react to this. And no I truly don’t find it a coincidence that this documentary came out the same year of the 10th anniversary of his death. It’s just so disgusting and heart breaking to see a man who did so much good in this world get torn to pieces as if he was nothing more than trash on the street.</p><ul class=children><li class="comment even depth-3" id=comment-6116064><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8b9c5bc0fb837e69075a66196a363f94?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Jenny Moser <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 8:19 pm</a><p>Thank you L.

Mj wouldn’t help him get his screenplays into Hollywood, plus Evan was jealous his ex-wife and his son spent so nuch time with Michael. It was never a criminal case. The Chandler’s strictly wanted money. They planned their plot to coincide with MJ’s huge world-wide tour. Attorneys, managers, and Michael knew much more money would be lost if the tour was cancelled for a civil court case. 20 million was a drop in the bucket to move on with his life. Je always said he regreted paying them. He just wasn’t strong enough to go against his managers who saw nothing but tour $$$.

MJ paid it, NOT AN INSURANCE COMPANY ACCORDING TO TOM MESEREAU in 2 interviews, one interview recently given to John Ziegler and a previous interview given to King Jordan radio on 1/2/14 he spoke about it to a caller named “Lynette.” Michael Jackson paid the $25 Million settlement because it was the 300 Lb Gorilla in the room according to his own lawyer, Carl E. Douglas during the “Frozen In Time” seminar. No innocent man pays out $25 Million dollars to settle if he’s innocent. He should have let the criminal trial go forward if he was innocent. Instead his lawyers which included Jonnie Cochrane told MJ to pay the huge settlement to JORDAN CHANDLER and pay a second settlement to Jason Francia for $2.5 Million!!!<br>Even Sandusky defender, John Ziegler sounded flabbergasted when Tom Mesereau told him that NO INSURANCE COMPANY paid the settlement, he stumbled around for a second and said, “So, that’s GOOD…to know…”<br>…blah blah blah” he had nothing else to say and changed the subject. MJ was Guilty in the ’93 case, even Aphrodite Jones said so in multiple interviews she gave. She said she was “unnerved” by June Chandler’s testimony about Michael begging her to sleep with Jordy in BED. Grown men do not sleep in bed with children and they sure as heck do not start to cry when told, “No you can’t sleep in bed with my KID.” But then again, I’m a PARENT. Most of MJ’s STANS seem to be childless older women and men who are clueless.<br>Even MJ himself put masks on his kids and never let them spend the night with anyone, he was totally OVERPROTECTIVE OF HIS KIDS against potential predators like himself.</p><ul class=children><li class="comment odd alt depth-3" id=comment-6121298><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eef379e779e63ea959a099f1c5590b01?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>M.M.

Denino, in the interview with John Ziegler, Thomas Mesereau said “the insurance company, to my knowledge, did not engineer that settlement at all”. For argument’s sake, let’s accept your words that Mesereau told him “NO INSURANCE COMPANY paid the settlement”. So he said that, and he also said that Michael was given really bad advice and that Michael regretted listening to that advice. He then said “The settlement agreement specifically said he doesn’t admit any guilt”. Why are you only focusing on the insurance comment? What about the rest of what Thomas Mesereau said?</p><p>You say: “MJ was Guilty in the ’93 case, even Aphrodite Jones said so in multiple interviews she gave”:<br>Have you seen any of the interviews where she said she went into the 2005 trial believing he was guilty and came out believing he was innocent?

This is what was said:<br>“There had been an occasion where Michael Jackson was examined, and his genitalia was recorded, which was part of an investigation. And that was part of the 300 pound gorilla in the mediation room.”<br>…”we were facing the purple gorilla in the room of If we don’t get this case settled before March, there is a criminal investigation looming, and no one wanted to consider the implications of that as it affected Michael Jackson”</p><p>J. Denino, where is the mention of Chandler’s drawing?</p><p>All they said was that Michael Jackson’s genitalia was recorded and that they are concerned about the implications of how that would affect Michael if there was a trial. Isn’t that a reasonable concern? Even if Chandler hadn’t done a drawing, the police had already examined Michael Jackson and taken pictures. No one, whether guilty or innocent, would want to have to discuss their genitalia in a public trial. So where’s the guilt?</p><p>…and yes, this is the point where we jump back onto the never-ending merry-go-round of grown men sleeping in bed with children, which does not have to mean pedophilia, but you say it does and I say it doesn’t and that’s all we’re really left with.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 parent" id=comment-6115774><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ae9519e8096fc893f9e45e104346a7c?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Lenie <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 1:43 am</a><p>L.John, Thank you for explaining.

Why would he draw a circumcised penis if Michael Jackson was not circumcised? Clearly it did not match. Doesnt matter what he knows about circumcision or not.

Unless you are Michael Jackson, apparently. Jordie Chandler’s description pf Michael’s private parts was dead wrong, otherwise, MJ would have been indicted. He even said he was circumcised, while the autopsy proved he wasn’t! How can you mistake THAT?! TWO grand juries refused to indict for lack of evidence. Yes, he was eccentric, but that doesn’t make him guilty of these heinous actions. You can’t compare him to other men his age because he was not like other men. His life experiences were not at all normal. He was a perpetual child in many ways. There are a lot of children who slept in his “bedroom” (huge, two story private quarters that is nothing like the bedrooms we sleep in) because they enjoyed his company. He was fun. He cared. He listened. He had sleepovers, like children do. Sleepovers, not hook ups! And it wasn’t just boys who wanted to stay with him, although that’s what the media says. It was also girls, and parents, but you won’t hear the media sharing that information. He was a big child himself. He missed out on his childhood because he was always performing. He didn’t socialize outside his family much as a youngster, and he didn’t get to do kid things. He didn’t want any child to miss out on being a kid. I think he lived vicariously through them. Due to his fame, he could not just go to the pool, to the zoo, the park, a skating rink, or even a county fair. So he built his dream childhood behind gates, and shared it with sick and underprivileged children, as well as children involved in show business.<br>He loved to see them smile and laugh. He cared. He listened. It wasn’t “grooming.” He was trying to be a friend. He just got along with and identified more with children than with adults. Why can’t the media understand that? The media and public assume “slept in the same bed” must mean hanky panky is going on. These are probably the same people who do not believe than men and women can be friends without anything sexual happening. The timing of LN gives away the real motive. Not once was the word “alleged” used. This sham of a “documentary” told only one point of view. Michael isn’t here to defend himself, and to be able to face his accusers. Accusers who, when he was alive, came to his defense. If you look at the court transcripts, you can see Robson wasn’t asked if he had been abused. He was asked if he was touched, if various specific acts were performed upon him. In LN, he claims he did not know he was being abused. That reasoning doesn’t fly, because under penalty of perjury, he was specifically asked if MJ ever touched him, etc. and he said no. What these men saw was an opportunity for fame and fortune at the expense of a man who truly was one of the most kind and generous celebrities the world has ever known. They had plenty of time to speak up during the prior trial, or anytime before he died. But no. After failing to successfully sue Michael’s estate, after being rejected for a job, Robson and his co-conspirator released a slanderous “documentary” that just happens to coincide with the 10th anniversary of his death. I wish I had a friend like MJ when I was a kid. He restored my faith in the human race. We fear and attack what we do not understand. Presumed innocent. Alleged. Familiarize yourself with these words and do the research. Look at the actual evidence. There is absolutely zero proof of any wrongdoing. Poor judgement, perhaps, by the standards of ordinary people. But MJ was not ordinary. The truth and real motive for this slanderous program will become abundantly clear.<br>#IKnewLeavingNeverlandWasBS</p><ul class=children><li class="comment even depth-2" id=comment-6116087><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/01d6341f300e4fd73423a368e1f38a9b?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Yuri <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 9:24 pm</a><p>Im so glad knowing there are people like you out there who actually know what’s up.

I think it is important to decipher and REMEMBER WHAT IT IMPORTANT here! Yes, I believe MJ had great qualities, but realistically the man waa flawed, like every single other living creature on this planet! Do I believe he was the greatest entertainer to date? Absolutely. Do I believe he did a lot of great in the world, humanitarian wise? Absolutely. Do I believe there is realistically a chance he may have molested children. We all need to agreed, there is a chance, yes he may have been a child molester. On the flip side, theres a chance he was not. And in this country we are innocent until proven otherwise, which should be the case. But because of who he was, we are trying to make an example of him. This is wrong. He was declared innocent in court and exonerated. However in public opinion he has be exiled. This is wrong. Again, WE ARE MISSING THE PROBLEM WHICH INSTEAD OF ARGUING ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON AND DEMEANING HIS MANY GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS, WE SHOULD BE REALIZING THAT WHETHER HE DID IT OR NOT? SEX ABUSE AND MOLESTATION IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN WE HAVE EVER EVEN NOTICED. WHY ARE WE BATTLING EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF WAKING UP AND HUNTING DOWN AND PENALIZING THE CRIMINALS AND ABUSERS OUT THERE TODAY STILL COMFORTABLY COMMITTING THESE CRIMES. THE ONES ALIVE STILL ABLE TO HURT VICTIMS!!! Where are all these people attacking MJ and fans or people who have the rite to think hes innocent, where are they during the Weinstein trial?! Why arent you on those forums instead, seeking justice?! Like I said do I believe MJ COULD HAVE done it? It’s possible. Am i going to throw away my MJ memorabilia and stop listening to his music? Absolutely not. I separated the artistry and the artist from the man. Why are we demonizing a man who not only cannot defend himself but can no longer hurt anyone else? We need to be standing together in unity and ho after the sons of bitches still committing these crimes today.

We must remember that the MeToo movement has created a climate for many abused persons to finally come forward at long last and talk about their ordeals in a new environment where they at least have a chance of being taken seriously and being believed. Alas, it also unwittingly offers a portal through which liars, shysters and profiteers can squeeze through in desperation when other means have failed. Robson-Safchuck-Reed are in the latter category. R. Kelly was given the opportunity to defend himself in the multi-part film which showcased his accusors.

The eighties were a time in our history when we were not as aware of sex abuse that was taking place in all kinds of institutions from the Catholic church to the Boy Scouts. Grown men should not be sleeping in bed unsupervised with underaged minors who are not their own kids, I don’t care how “big” his bed was, and yes I have seen Larry Nimmer’s film, “The Untold Story of Neverland.” Jackson’s bedroom was not the size of a house and his bed wasn’t “huge” it was a normal king sized bed that many Americans own. His bedroom was a cluttered mess, there were piles of clutter so high that you barely had space between the bed and the piles of books, games, magazines, baby dolls, mannequins of boys scout children and other mannequins, cribs with mannequins in them, stereo speakers piled high with stuff, books, cds, tapes, dvds, and tons of other bric a brak.<br>Would you let your child spend the night in your next door neighbor’s king sized bed because it was a king size bed? I think not. MJ acted in a highly inappropriate manner with these “special friends” of his who he called “Rubba” “Applehead” & “Doo Doo Head” in the case of “his son” which he lied about, Omer is not his son, his father is Pakistani and his mother is Norwegian. Jackson lied when he told people that these “special friends” of his were his “cousins” “brothers” “sons” to strangers he ran into while on tours around the world, he also hid these kids in cars at times so that the press wouldn’t see them, At other times he didn’t care what they said when he was walking around holding hands wearing matching outfits and trading/sharing his sunglasses with them up to and including on the HIStory Teaser with an older, approximately 15 y.o. James Safechuck who was wearing MJ’s mirrored silver framed sunglasses while Jackson wore James’ ordinary aviator glasses. They switched right before the filming. MJ was sending signals to the world who his lovers were imo whether they were current or past lovers working for him in the production crew wearing his glasses/holding his umbrella for him which happened to be pink. James also danced on stage with MJ in a matching outfit during the Bad tour in 1989 when he was ten years old. Only his superfans make up stories about how MJ had “secret girlfriends” while he paraded these young boys around very publicly, holding hands with them and having them wear matching outfits and letting them wear his sunglasses while he would wear their’s. They somehow came up with an excuse when the stunning Tatiatna Thumbtzen (who was on the tour in NYC) tried to kiss MJ on the stage and MJ had his manager Frank D. fire her, though he let Frank take the blame for it everyone knows that MJ ran his own shows and had the last word. No one did anything without his approval. They claimed that Tatiana was acting like a diva, really?<br>The boys he brought on his tours with him and spent nights in hotel rooms around the world also were photographed wearing his oversized jackets and shirts which did not fit them. MJ also had his personal tailor make matching “Bad” tour outfits for Jimmy Safechuck and matching “HIStory Tour” outfits for Omer as well as the infamous matching red or yellow shirts with the “CTE” initials on the shoulders which no one seems to know what they stand for (“Children of The Earth” has been speculated) on the epaulets on the shoulder of the shirt. I saw that shirt on Frank C. in a photo and MJ himself wore that shirt often, I believe he wore it on his Oprah special in 1993. He wasn’t fooling anyone, he was actually sending out “smoke” signals that he was in a “relationship” with these kids imo. He was seen in a comic book store on Melrose by a comic book writer who is now deceased named James Hudnall (in an interview he gave to Ed Opperman) who described Jackson and Jordy Chandler as being in a relationship, holding hands in the store and disappearing into a bathroom for a long period of time. Does a 13 y.o. need help using the “loo”? I think not. He was also seen in another comic book store in NYC, “Forbidden Planet” by a women named Ms. Kennedy who worked in the store in the 90’s where she recounted how MJ tried to enter the employee restroom as she was assisting the young child of approximately age 4 in MJ’s entourage who was using the one person restroom but she had to stop MJ from entering the restroom because due to the 1993 allegations she was rightly suspicious of his motives. Jackson had arrived at the store she worked in in NYC with a group of kids and some bodyguards in the mid 1990’s after the Jordy Chandler scandal and payoff. We all heard that he paid off Jordan Chandler for millions of dollars, there was also NO INSURANCE COMPANY involved according to Tom Mesereau in 2 interviews he gave. In the first interview 5 years ago on approximately 1/3/2014 he was being interviewed on King Jordan radio when a women by the name of Lynette called him and asked him whether an insurance company had paid, according to Tom an insurance company had not paid. Recently Tom gave an interview to John Ziegler, the right wing radio host who defends Jerry Sandusky and claimed that J.S. was 100% innocent, he also interviewed him in prison. Anyway Tom Mesereau told John Ziegler in a recent interview that No Insurance Company had paid off Jordan Chandler. He said MJ was advised to pay the boy off by his lawyers and business advisors. MJ did so. Now I have to ask would you pay off over $25 Million to two accusers if you’re innocent? Why didn’t MJ fight it in court? He paid it because the description that Jordy gave matched the police photos that were taken, that is why he paid large sums of money in the millions to two accusers.<br>MJ had major boundary problems with children. He crossed the line with way too many kids, even Aaron Carter said on tape that MJ gave him WINE when he was 15, he then said that MJ was 40 y.o. when he gave him wine and if he were 40 he would not be giving a 15 y.o. wine as it is inappropriate. MJ was also accused of giving Gavin Arviso alcohol but the jury had reasonable doubt and acquitted him, that doesn’t mean that he was “innocent” that means that there was “reasonable doubt” which it doesn’t take much of to acquit someone, particularly a rich celebrity who hires a Harvard trained lawyer to represent him. Him being found not guilty doesn’t mean he’s innocent. He paid out numerous multimillion dollar settlements to his “alleged” accusers/victims.</p><ul class=children><li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id=comment-6116102><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/86a21249fb7c17cdb4e25f2b5812bbf0?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>L. Johns <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 10:39 pm</a><p>J.Denino, Okay since you were wondering who would pay off a $25 million dollar lawsuit, it was because that lawsuit that he paid off was a civil lawsuit not a criminal lawsuit, because back then you could have a civil lawsuit filed before a criminal lawsuit. They only paid the civil lawsuit off because they believed it would save them more money than to go through with it because going to court and fighting lawsuits is not cheap at all let alone 2 lawsuits. They didn’t pay that family the money to “make it go away”, they paid it to get it out of the way so they could put their focus on the criminal lawsuit which was the more important one but, as we all know, the chandler family took that money and ran. His own Niece said this herself. Now let’s put this into question. If you were truly a parent of a molested child, would you just take a large amount of money and run with it? No, you wouldn’t because any normal parent would not stop until they saw the molester put behind bars or dead. This family ran once they got the money and never spoke another word about it except for Jordan, the so called “victim”. He came out and admitted that he was never molested and that his father wanted money. There was even a phone call from Evan Chandler, his father, talking about his mission on taking Michael down and ruining his reputation. This phone call happened BEFORE Jordan even came out and said he was abused. Let’s also not forget the fact that Jordan claimed to being molested by Michael, after his OWN FATHER drugged him with Amytal Sodium, which may I add, is a drug that has been proven to make many people give out false statements. Jordan even got emancipated from his father after he got the money and never spoke to his father again, who ended up committing suicide a few months after Michael passed away. We definitely can’t forget how Jordan couldn’t even give out a correct description of Michaels genitalia. At one point he said Michael was circumcised when in fact he wasn’t, and it is not hard at all to know the difference between a circumcised genitalia and an uncircumcised genitalia. The only reason someone may not know the difference is if they’ve never been taught the difference or if they’ve never seen the difference themselves. Jordan was also asked to testify against Michael during his 2nd trial but he did anything and everything to not be found. He did not want to be a part of that. I find that funny because if Michael truly would have molested him, wouldn’t he have wanted to try and fight to get Michael put behind bars so he wouldn’t be able to molest more children and also to stick up for Gavin Arvizo, another child who had claimed to be molested by Jackson… but he wanted no part. In fact most people can’t even find Jordan now, because of how hard he’s tried to distance himself from that situation in 1993. And going back to Evan Chandler, what type of father who truly believed his son was molested by a grown ass man would let that grown ass man walk away a free man, who would be able to molest more children, instead of fighting to get that man put behind bars??? It makes no sense! They only wanted money! Same for the Arvizo family and same for Wade and James. Michael was investigated for 10 years by the FBI! 10 years!!!! And they found nothing that came across as him being a child molester. Nothing at all!! These people just want money. You brought up many times to use as examples, that Michael would have custom clothing made for Jordan and so on an so forth, he would switch sunglasses with them, and hold hands with the children. To respond to the first example, I’m going to bring up the time Michael met Princess Diana. When Michael met Princess Diana and Prince Charles in 1988, this was during his bad tour when they stopped at the Wembley Arena. During this period Diana already had, had Prince William and Prince Harry. Of course Michael knew this, and so he decided to make custom jackets for William and Harry as a gift… Diana didn’t find this strange at all, and neither do I. For the next 2 examples I honestly just feel like he had a bond with those kids. In high school I took my teachers glasses and wore them around during the class period, and no one in that class found it weird, it was just funny. I was being a kid. And also, although it’s not exactly the same, I hold hands with my friends all the time and I say this because I truly felt that Michael viewed these children as his friends so to him it wasn’t strange holding their hand, it was just two friends being friends but ofc to the outside world it looked incredibly inappropriate. And if Michael holding hands with children was as inappropriate as many people want to believe, then how come the parents of those children didn’t stop it? Why did the parents continue to bring those children back to visit Michael? Michael didn’t grow up normally. By the age of 5 he was already singing and shortly after that he was known all around the world. He didn’t have a childhood. He couldn’t go outside and play with friends, he couldn’t celebrate birthdays and Christmas because at the time he was a Jehovahs Witness, he couldn’t do normal things like going to prom, going to the movies, going out to eat with friends and so on and so forth because he would be rehearsing and recording or going on tour. Michael was an incredibly lonely person. Everyday he was ridiculed and torn apart for anything and everything he did or didn’t do. He didn’t have many real friends, he didn’t feel like he could trust most people, he was incredibly shy and kept to himself a lot and to him the only people that were his true friends were children because to him children have pure hearts. He felt like they wouldn’t judge him, and they never did. To them, Michael was a best friend. Macauley Culkin is one of the best people to use as an example of this. He has never changed his story on the normal, and fun friendship he had with Michael, who also said himself that Michaels bedroom was like a palace and that his bed was huge. A person who personally knew him for years admitted to that and so have many of his bodyguards. None of what you said points to the fact that Michael was a child molester. And we truly can’t forget about all the lies and things being left out of the LN “documentary” like the lies being told about the train station being built during specific events that took place, the lie that James refused to testify for Michael during his 2nd trials, although he was never asked to testify for Michael (said by Tom Mesereau himself who was Michaels defense attorney during the 2nd allegations), or what actually happened when Wade claimed his family was at the Grand Canyon while he was alone with Michael. Those are just a few lies that have been debunked, but there are so many more lies people have found. And honestly I can understand a documentary making a simple mistake or victims forgetting and making a simple mistake on things but these 2 men have lied time after time after time and their story is truly not believable. I also find it quite funny how not only is this “documentary” one sided but it fails to bring up the fact that Wade dated Michaels niece, Brandi Jackson, for around 8 years, how Wade, after begging Michael for permission, got married at Neverland while Michael was not there, how Wade didn’t start accusing Michael of abuse until AFTER the MJ estate refused to let him take part in the Cirque De Soleil tribute performances, he was also absolutely broke during this period in time. Also how many people, like Ron Newt and Macauley Culkin, were bribed with money to try and say that Michael touched them, or in Ron Newts case, touched his kids, how Michael was actually rarely at Neverland because of how much he traveled, how Michael was never truly alone in the room with the boys because another adult figure would be in there with them, said by Michaels body guard himself and other friends of Michael, and so on and so forth. This whole documentary is just another way to ruin Michaels legacy and for people to get money. Wade even tried before to get money from Michael in 2013 but that case was thrown out because he had waited too long to file against Michael. People are literally just watching this “documentary” and immediately siding with the victims even though not once has actual proof been given to support the claim that Michael was a child molester. You saying “we should believe the boys when they say that they were improperly touched by MJ”, just because Michael constantly admitted to sharing beds with children is just idiotic. We have seen time after time, people getting falsely accused of a crime, yet people seem to forget about this and not put this into perspective when it comes to Michael. People in this world don’t even think for themselves anymore. They’re so brainwashed by what the media and society says and it’s disgusting. If people took the time to look at both the sides of Wade/James and of Michael, and actually spent time looking up the facts, then they would understand why so many people, like myself, continue to fight for Michael. Wade and James have lied too many times for me to believe a word they say. People seriously just do the research, it’s truly worth it!</p></li><li class="comment even depth-2" id=comment-6116241><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e7ff65a4e65c1d8541e73e5308ed401b?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Getoffmytits <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 9, 2019 at 10:07 am</a><p>@JDENINO<br>Does the word of a person who was a complete stranger, who seen Michael one time in life, outweigh the recollection of Michael’s actual friends who were there?</p><p>Like Frank Cascio, who wrote in his book: “Now, I know that most grown men don’t share their private quarters with children, and those who do so are almost always up to no good. But that wasn’t my experience with Michael. As one of those kids who, along with his brother, had any number of such sleepovers with Michael, I know better than anyone else what did happen and what didn’t happen. Was it normal to have children sleep over? No. But it’s also not considered especially normal for a grown man to play with Silly String or have water balloon fights, at least not with the enthusiasm Michael brought to the activities. It’s also not normal for a grown man to have an amusement park installed in his backyard. Do these things make such a man a pedophile?</p><p>I’m quite sure that the answer is no.</p><p>The bottom line: Michael’s interest in young boys had absolutely nothing to do with sex. I say this with the unassailable confidence of firsthand experience, the confidence of a young boy who slept in the same room as Michael hundreds of times, and with the absolute conviction of a man who saw Michael interact with thousands of kids. In all the years that I was close to him, I saw nothing that raised any red flags, not as a child and not as an adult. Michael may have been eccentric, but that didn’t make him a criminal.”</p><p>I’ve seen your YouTube channel and I wonder what exactly you are trying to accomplish. Because Michael is dead and if Wade and James are suing for 1.5 billion dollars, that is taking away from Michael’s children. But I guess those who believes Michael is guilty cares about his children. They certainly don’t care about what THEY have to say about the entire ordeal.</p></li><li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id=comment-6116315><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eef379e779e63ea959a099f1c5590b01?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>M.M.

Let’s not lie, in March when LN came out , it’s clear on Apple’s and Billboard’s chart that mj’s Music streams increased rapidly. Now, with the radio stations and dj’s, it’s all shrug-able. Even before LN came out they barely played his music, it’s not like the estate only make some money from the amount of spins . Anyways, after watching LN I’ve came to 2 conclusions. 1, it’s long , mildly explicit, and kind of boring. The whole movie is 4 hours long, why do you need 4 hours of a sex abuse story? Many victims had a timeline of numerous occasions when they were abused , and they fit It in an 1 hour and 30 minute documentary . When the accusers speak about their abuse , it’s highly explicit, they go into deep detail of what and how Michael allegedly sexually abused them. It causes great uncomforbility for the viewers. It made me feel like a pedophile, it was truly unnecessary to go into huge detail. This film could be a fantasy for pedophiles, again it was really unneeded for the explicit detail in the alleged sexual acts. 2 , it’s very one sided, in LN the 2 accusers has their family in support, but no one that “was “on Michael’s behalf, in support of the accusers. In the R Kelly documentary, his therapist , ex wife, friends and etc was there to tell their side in support of the accusers . It seems the accusers are forcing the viewers to change their previous opinion on Michael, drastically. Majority of the public believed 100% of their story, it wasn’t until a week later that articles reported some parts of their stories was lies. I was in shock that the media would’ve reported anything against the accusers this time, instead of Michael. Even the director of the “documentary “ came out and said there is inconsistencies within it. I started to have narrow eyes for the accusers side, and after I did more research on wade his reasoning for past actions and it was constantly changed . I’ve looked at the 93 settlement and the 2005 court case , it seemed that the reasoning of the cases were about money. This also drove me to research about why Michael thought sleeping in the bed with children was okay. He once said in a 2005 interview that he grew up with sleeping ( as in napping) with others was a normality because people would often sleep with him as a child . Bobby Taylor in specific, he shared after Michael died ,that he would sleep with Michael , in the 60’s . Bobby was a grown man sleeping in the bed with Michael,a child. Michael and him were not related in blood , it was normal to just nap in bed with a minor without sexual intensions in that day of age. However , Michael said numerous amount of times that he would usually sleep on the floor and the child would take his bed, he said it was to show respect to the guest. Anyways, at the end of the day people can judge if Michael was innocent or not , but court verdict says innocent. Before LN , I thought Michael was a complete creep but after LN , my opinion changed.</p></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id=comment-6115989><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aff4cd6ca3fd05c79af2b0d6627392bb?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>MartaMjlover <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 5:45 pm</a><p>Both wade robson & james safechuck lied thru damn teeth .<br>due your damn research. and dan reed bought both of their bs hook.<br>they are both hurting big time for money still. they are still using Michael Jackson as their escape goat so any f*cking thing they can do to destroy his good name & image all in the name of money they will do.

Unless you are Evil or confused nobody wants to hear or see anything on l anymore BS lies about Michael. He is greatly loved. If a network wants to cancel a big event for Michael.

The music video by Sean Lennon certainly should be looked at an analyzed in context with MJ’s music videos. He seems to have a message that he is sending the world about Michael Jackson. Also, the song is quite good, imo.</p></li></ul></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id=comment-6116076><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3adf720c55759748acc77db02be45828?s=32&d=mm&r=pg" height=32 width=32 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Nina F <span class=says>says:</span> <a href=#>June 8, 2019 at 8:55 pm</a><p>J.Denino, you wanted my “long-winded explanation,” presumably where I’d expound on Michael Jackson’s guilt or innocence.

They have no evidence of anything other than they met Michael Jackson. It is law innocent till proven guilty. James & Wade are perjurers and liars proven. Oh and by the way, for the commenter further down the page it was Lloyds of London (insurance) that paid out the Chandlers. Michael Jackson wanted to go to court and the insurance paid out against his instructions.
