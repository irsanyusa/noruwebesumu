As a six-time winner of the ‘Faculty of the Year’ award, which is voted for by students,, NEWTON is the obvious choice for ambitious individuals looking to lay the foundations of an international business career.</p><p dir=ltr>Our <a href=#>bachelor’s degree in Global Business and Management</a> is designed to give the next generation of business leaders the tools they need to shape the workplaces of tomorrow. The success of our programme is attested to by the fact that numerous NEWTON University Alumni have been featured in the Czech Forbes 30 Under 30 list.</p><p dir=ltr>Our innovative curriculum combines Economics, Management and Psychology, to ensure that our students have all the tools they need to build and grow their own businesses. Special emphasis is put on developing the mindset of a true and effective manager and entrepreneur. It is our belief that if you want to lead others, you must first understand yourself; we therefore teach students to understand their strengths, to actively self-develop, and to cultivate critical thinking skills.</p><p dir=ltr>Alongside this, students gain a theoretical understanding of modern business practices, as well as participating in practical seminars and managerial training. And on the English programme, students use professional English on a day-to-day basis, opening the door to a truly international entrepreneurial career.</p><p dir=ltr><img alt="Newton University" decoding=async height=800 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vysokeskoly.cz/czech-universities/uploads/2021/06/39.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p dir=ltr>And at NEWTON, you don’t even have to wait until you graduate to begin your entrepreneurial journey: In 2021, NEWTON has launched a business accelerator programme to support current students to set up and operate their own businesses. One of the first enterprises to be supported by the accelerator is a project making edible cups to reduce plastic waste. The company, set up by two second year students, is gaining widespread media attention in Czechia and beyond.</p><p dir=ltr>NEWTON also offers unparalleled networking opportunities both inside and outside the classroom. Students learn from a diverse academic faculty, who combine both academic and real-world business experience. In addition to this, we have regular guest lecturers from the private sector and public sectors. Previous speakers have included Vladimír Tomšík, the former Vice-Governor of the Czech National Bank and current ambassador to China, and Stanislav Gálik, the CEO of Aures Laboratories.</p><p dir=ltr>The opportunities afforded by studying at NEWTON extend far beyond the borders of Czechia: As NEWTON is a member of the Erasmus+ programme, all of our students have the opportunity to study abroad during their degree with one of our partner institutions around the world.</p><p dir=ltr>Students come to study at NEWTON from all over the world, enabling us to offer a truly cosmopolitan educational environment. Whether you’re already in Prague, or still considering whether to make Czechia your study destination, NEWTON has a learning option to suit you.</p><p dir=ltr><img alt="Newton University" decoding=async height=800 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vysokeskoly.cz/czech-universities/uploads/2021/06/LM_3242.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p dir=ltr>For students who are already in Czechia, or who decide to relocate for the duration of their degree, we offer a full-time in-person study programme on our campus in Prague. This course option allows students to fully take part in the academic and social life of NEWTON University.</p><p dir=ltr>We also offer flexible study patterns to suit students who prefer to study remotely.
