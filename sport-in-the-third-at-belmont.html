He raced to victory on horses with such names as Man o’ War, Zev, Flying Ebony, Gallant Fox. and he won the Kentucky Derby three times, the Belmont Stakes five times. In a time of purses far smaller than today’s, he brought home more than $3,000,000 worth. In the age of sport known as golden, Jockey Earl Sande was the best in his business.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There was even a verse about him; it showed how the ’20s felt about Earl Sande, even if it taught a lot of people to mispronounce the name (rhymes with grand). Wrote Columnist Damon Runyon with a Broadway mist in his eye:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maybe there’ll be another,</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Heady and game and true—</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maybe we’ll find his brother</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At driving them horses through.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maybe—but, say, I doubt it,</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Never his like again—</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Never a handy guy like Sande</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bootin’ them babies in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By 1928, when Sande was 29, he was finding it hard to keep trimmed down to racing weight, and he called it a career. He made comebacks in 1930 and 1932, then settled down as a horse trainer. Last week, his share of $3,000,000 worth of purses long gone, Earl Sande told his fellow trainers at Belmont Park that he was ready to try booting them in again. At 54, he had managed to diet down to 113 Ibs., about 25 less than he weighed last spring. Examined by a track doctor, Earl was pronounced fit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the third race at Belmont early this week, Earl had himself a mount. Trainer Hirsch Jacobs asked him to ride Honest Bread, an undistinguished three-year-old gelding who finished out of the money in his only start this year. The crowd gave the bald little jockey a roaring reception, and sentimentally made his horse the second favorite. Jockey Sande brought his mount in third. “I got a little tired and so did the horse,” said Sande, “but at least we didn’t dissolve our partnership.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ucm9lZoFwv8%2Boqa1lmaN6tbTEZquhoaKZeqLAjJucpaWfo8Fw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
