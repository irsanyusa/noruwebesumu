Teach me how to be humble and endure the troubles that shake my faith. May your mercy upon me win me favour on earth. Guide me in everything I do so I will testify to Your greatness.</li><li>Dear Father God, I praise and thank You for Your loving-kindness and great mercy, which is new every morning and remains steadfast and sure throughout the day. Thank You for the glory of the cross. Knowing I was estranged from Your heart of love and an outcast from the kingdom of heaven shames me. Words cannot describe the joy that You sent Your only begotten Son to live a life of rejection and pain. He suffered and died on the cross of Calvary for my forgiveness. Forgive my sins so I may live with You eternally in heaven.</li><li>Lord, in whatever way that I have sinned against you and disobeyed your word and instructions, show me mercy according to your loving-kindness and forgive my sins according to your compassion that endures forever.</li><li>Dear God, I come to You as a sinner undeserving of Your grace and presence. I repent all my sins and ask You to forgive me so that my request may be heard. Lord, have mercy on me and fill me with Your grace. Wash me with the blood of Your son Jesus Christ that I may shine and walk unashamed. I ask for Your favour from this moment to the end of the day. I thank You, for You are faithful.</li><li>Christ Jesus, through you, all my sins have been washed away. You have paid all my debts, and I now stand free with no one to point a finger at me. It is Your mercy that keeps me alive. You gave yourself wholly so that I may live. Thank you, Jesus, for Your unending love and mercy. Pour upon me Your grace and strength to always stand in faith.</li><li>Christ, my saviour, Your wounds remind me of the suffering I put you through. Have mercy on me and wash me with thy blood and water. Cleanse me and make me whole again. Redeem my soul and make me a vessel of your work that I may testify of your unending mercies</li><li>Oh, most merciful God, hear my cry and look to me with your merciful eyes. I may not be worthy of your presence Lord, but I strip myself of all connection to fleshly desires and bind myself to you. Father, show mercy upon me and stretch Your hand towards me in time of need.</li><li>Heavenly Father, with every breath I take, I feel your power in me. I am thankful for the gift of life and for the gift of the church. Lord, I ask that You open the eyes of my heart so that I may live righteously as you teach us. Lord, May I dwell in Your church empowered by Your Holy Spirit to keep spreading your Gospel. May your mercy on me save me from the temptations of the world.</li><li>Dear God, I love and adore You. I am grateful for every breath I take, a roof over my head, the shoes on my feet, and the food on my table. Lord, I pray for Your love and mercy to complete me and make me whole. As a human, I find myself complaining and being ungrateful. Teach me to always be content and ignite my heart’s desire to live in your presence.</li><li>Father, Most High, I fall before your throne, acknowledging your power and might over the whole universe. I am just a tiny being among the many You created, those we know and many more that we do not know. Remember me, oh God, as you bless each and every other being in Your creation.

It also reconnects them with God and other people in spite of their differences.</p><p class=align-left>Pastor Nelson explained that God had fulfilled the demands of justice by having Jesus Christ pay the full price for our sins. He said:</p>The only way (in Christianity) is to first receive the mercy of God that has been made available to us in salvation. Once we have received it, we are not only forgiven but empowered to live above sin.When people find it hard to be forgiven, I don't blame them because God's love can look “scandalous.” But that's why He is God because He can do what no one else can do.<h2>How do I pray to God for mercy?</h2><p class=align-left>You can request The Almighty for mercy by saying one or more of the prayers above.
