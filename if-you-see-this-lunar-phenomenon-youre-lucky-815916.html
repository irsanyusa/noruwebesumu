Our little companion. Our only friend in&nbsp;the big, dark, cold space. It’s not surprising that any events related to&nbsp;it, like solar or&nbsp;lunar eclipses, excite&nbsp;us. But how about... the black Moon? The blue Moon? A&nbsp;supermoon? Have you ever heard of&nbsp;them?</p><p>Well, let me&nbsp;tell you about it&nbsp;and how you can observe them. Let’s get your calendars ready. The distance between the <a href=# title=Earth data-link=tag>Earth</a> and the Moon is&nbsp;238,900&nbsp;miles. Feels not so&nbsp;far, doesn’t it? But trust me&nbsp;— most people GREATLY underestimate this distance! Did you know that every planet in&nbsp;the <a href=# title="Solar System" data-link=tag>Solar System</a>, including <a href=# title=Jupiter data-link=tag>Jupiter</a> and <a href=# title=Saturn data-link=tag>Saturn</a>, would fit between the Moon and&nbsp;us? I&nbsp;couldn’t believe it&nbsp;myself!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b30/c12/d5a3e8555ebe70b2d546f19df7.png><p>The Moon is&nbsp;tidally locked to&nbsp;the Earth. That’s why it’s always turned to&nbsp;us with only one side. There are a&nbsp;few phases in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lunar cycle. The new Moon is&nbsp;the first phase. The Sun illuminates the unseen side of&nbsp;our satellite, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can’t see the Moon. It’s almost invisible in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=sky data-link=tag>sky</a>. The rising Moon is&nbsp;the gradual growth of&nbsp;the light part. The Full Moon is&nbsp;the phase during which the Sun completely illuminates the visible side. The descending Moon is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gradual waning of&nbsp;the light part. And finally, another new moon. And the whole cycle starts again. There are 29.5 days in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lunar cycle, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;takes around a&nbsp;month if&nbsp;we’re not talking about February. But why am&nbsp;I telling you all this?</p><p>So&nbsp;you can better understand “Black Moon”. A&nbsp;rare astronomical event that happens once every 29&nbsp;months, or&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;years. This term doesn’t exist in&nbsp;astronomy, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was made up&nbsp;by&nbsp;astrologers. It’s unofficial and has several meanings. “Black moon” may mean the second new Moon in&nbsp;a&nbsp;month. Usually, there’s only one new Moon per month, so&nbsp;having two is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare phenomenon. It’s caused by&nbsp;a&nbsp;slight discrepancy between the lunar cycle and the Earth’s annual one. Something like leap years. “Black moon” can also mean something else. For example, usually, there are only 3&nbsp;new moons per 1&nbsp;season. Basically, one new Moon every 30&nbsp;days. However, if&nbsp;there are&nbsp;4, the “black moon” means the third one. There are also some less popular meanings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/591/b13/8e1e1a5917b0506eef8fb61b21.png><p>For example, that’s what people call February without a&nbsp;new or&nbsp;full moon&nbsp;— this happens about once every 19&nbsp;years. But what’s so&nbsp;special about&nbsp;it? The satellite is&nbsp;wholly hidden in&nbsp;the sky during a&nbsp;regular new moon. But during a&nbsp;black moon, you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see its dark silhouette. You’ll have to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;good place without city lights. If&nbsp;you live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big city, you’ll hardly be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see it&nbsp;without a&nbsp;telescope.</p><p>Also, since the sky turns black during this phenomenon, you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see different constellations that were hidden before, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;Jupiter and <a href=# title=Venus data-link=tag>Venus</a>. The last time this happened was on&nbsp;April&nbsp;30, 2022. You could observe it&nbsp;in&nbsp;most parts of&nbsp;the United States. Except for the areas of&nbsp;Pacific, Alaska or&nbsp;Hawaiian time. Aloha! Yeah, unfortunately, if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;the first time you hear about the black Moon, you’ve already missed&nbsp;it. Now you’ll have to&nbsp;wait another 2.5 years&nbsp;— the next Black Moon will happen in&nbsp;September 2024 by&nbsp;standard definition and May&nbsp;19, 2023, by&nbsp;seasonal definition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ff1/83f/8389da564fbb17641b36aa629e.png><p>But don’t worry. You can always see another astronomical event... once upon a&nbsp;blue moon. I’m not mocking you. I’m being serious: you still can see the blue Moon. Well, not literally, of&nbsp;course&nbsp;— the Moon won’t turn blue... That’s just what astrologers call the second full Moon in&nbsp;a&nbsp;month. The black and blue moons are similar by&nbsp;definition, but they’re actually the opposites. If&nbsp;the black Moon is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare second new moon in&nbsp;a&nbsp;month, the Blue Moon is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare second full moon.</p><p>They also both happen every 29&nbsp;months. Not so&nbsp;rare, right? Kind of&nbsp;ironic that this event was called the “blue moon”. Folklorist Philip Hiscock assumed that the calendrical meaning of&nbsp;the term “Blue Moon” was first invented by&nbsp;the Maine Farmers’ Almanac in&nbsp;1937. Another interesting astronomical event is&nbsp;called the “supermoon”. Stock up&nbsp;on&nbsp;telescopes and look for some hills because you’ll see an&nbsp;exceptionally bright and large moon&nbsp;— like the one we&nbsp;only see in&nbsp;movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cd8/ede/a3cf0858ed83cf14f0963e9092.png><p>What exactly does a&nbsp;supermoon mean? You see, the Moon doesn’t revolve around the Earth in&nbsp;a&nbsp;circular orbit. Its orbit is&nbsp;elliptical. And the place where it’s closest to&nbsp;the Earth is&nbsp;called “perigee”. A&nbsp;supermoon is&nbsp;a&nbsp;phenomenon that occurs when the full Moon coincides with the perigee. Because of&nbsp;this, it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;us especially large and bright. It&nbsp;looks&nbsp;14% larger in&nbsp;diameter and&nbsp;30% brighter than usual. By&nbsp;the way, this phenomenon is&nbsp;often confused with the so-called “moon illusion”.</p><p>During the “moon illusion”, the Moon is&nbsp;low above the horizon and visually appears larger in&nbsp;size. Of&nbsp;the 12&nbsp;or 13&nbsp;full moons in&nbsp;a&nbsp;year, 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;are supermoons. But most of&nbsp;them are not very significant. You probably won’t see a&nbsp;difference at&nbsp;all. The most interesting ones are the rare large supermoons. During them, the Moon actually becomes big. The last major supermoon occurred in&nbsp;2016. Unfortunately, large-scale supermoons are rare and occur about once every 18&nbsp;years. The next one will happen only in&nbsp;2034. But we&nbsp;can observe smaller “supermoons” quite often. In&nbsp;2022, they’ll take place on&nbsp;June 14&nbsp;and July&nbsp;16.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ec7/930/e6e1435ff79c2f246e5d7a4837.png><p>There is&nbsp;also an&nbsp;opposite phenomenon called the “micro moon”. You’ve probably already guessed what that means. It&nbsp;happens when the full Moon is&nbsp;at&nbsp;its farthest point from the Earth. This point is&nbsp;called “apogee”. The next micro Moon in&nbsp;2022 will take place on&nbsp;June&nbsp;29. In&nbsp;2023, we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;observe it&nbsp;on&nbsp;January&nbsp;7, February&nbsp;5, and August&nbsp;16. Of&nbsp;course, you don’t have to&nbsp;follow each of&nbsp;these events. Most people are more interested in&nbsp;lunar and solar eclipses.</p><p>A&nbsp;solar eclipse is&nbsp;a&nbsp;phenomenon where the Moon entirely or&nbsp;partially covers the Sun. A&nbsp;solar eclipse is&nbsp;possible only during the new Moon when the Moon itself is&nbsp;not visible. Many people believe that this event is&nbsp;incredibly rare, but this is&nbsp;not quite true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e67/6e5/1ee24e5911a72892d2c07e1818.png><p>A&nbsp;lunar eclipse is&nbsp;a&nbsp;phenomenon in&nbsp;which the Moon is&nbsp;entirely or&nbsp;partially in&nbsp;the shadow cast by&nbsp;the Earth. The lunar eclipse can only happen during the full Moon when the proximity of&nbsp;the Moon is&nbsp;to&nbsp;the node of&nbsp;its orbit. If&nbsp;you guessed right&nbsp;— well done! If&nbsp;not, don’t worry. Many people confuse them. In&nbsp;2022, a&nbsp;partial solar eclipse will occur on&nbsp;October&nbsp;25. It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;visible in&nbsp;Europe, South and West Asia, North and East Africa, and the Atlantic. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;mentioned, a&nbsp;total solar eclipse is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;rare as&nbsp;many people think, but the problem is&nbsp;that it’s not always visible from any part of&nbsp;the planet. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;see this event, be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;look for their calendar and see from which parts of&nbsp;the Earth you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see&nbsp;it. And don’t forget the special glasses!</p><p>Lunar eclipses occur much more often, though. Partial lunar eclipses happen almost every month. But the total lunar eclipse in&nbsp;2022 will take place on&nbsp;the night of&nbsp;November 7th to&nbsp;8th. You’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see it&nbsp;in&nbsp;almost all parts of&nbsp;the world except Africa. I&nbsp;hear that the zebras are not happy about this. The Moon is&nbsp;a&nbsp;genuinely fascinating satellite. You think, whatever, it’s just a&nbsp;small rock ball. But in&nbsp;reality, there are so&nbsp;many interesting events connected to&nbsp;it!
