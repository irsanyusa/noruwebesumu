Released in 1903, he later wrote A Mind That Found Itself. A best-selling personal history, it drew the nation’s attention to the primitive brutality of its madhouses, led to reforms that helped many unbalanced minds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died.
