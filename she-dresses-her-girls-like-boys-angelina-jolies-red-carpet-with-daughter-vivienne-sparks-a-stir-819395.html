Angelina wowed in a seafoam green velvet gown with a matching shrug, adding some sparkle with jewelry. Vivienne looked sharp in a crisp white collared shirt, a teal vest, trousers, and a bow tie.</p><p>They were both there to support their Broadway musical, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Outsiders</i></a>, which was up for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>12 awards</a>. Angelina has been a producer on the show, and Vivienne worked as a producer’s assistant. Other than this, Angelina was also set to present at the ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/349/862/81be555cce8fda629e3c89c622.jpg><p>Evan Agostini/Invision/East News</p><p>Just recently, Vivienne <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reportedly</a> shortened her surname to just Jolie for the Broadway production's playbill. This comes amid Angelina Jolie and her ex-husband <a href=# title="Brad Pitt" data-link=tag>Brad Pitt</a>’s years-long legal battle. Vivienne isn't the only one of Angelina Jolie's children who reportedly wants to distance themselves from their father, Brad Pitt.</p><p>However, their red carpet appearance stunned fans who saw the pictures and commented on it. Many praised the mother-daughter outing, especially since they were there to support a project they worked on together. Some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, "She’s beautiful. And so is her daughter. I wish them well," and "This is the only celebrity mom that's always with her kids. Beautiful woman."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/187/577/5bf8bc52c7a871e292d242f72a.jpg><p>Evan Agostini/Invision/East News</p><p>However, some people pointed out and criticized something about her daughter, going beyond mere appearance and scrutinizing the whole look. Someone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>, "Whoever dressed this poor little soul for such an event should be fired!!!" Another user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a>, "Why does she dress her girls like boys?" and "Kid is dressed like a dude waiter."</p><p>Others noticed the resemblance between Vivienne and her father, Brad Pitt, with many comments highlighting this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>similarity</a>, such as, "Her daughter looks exactly like Brad Pitt," or "She looks totally like her dad."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/20f/570/d98657520e8a42c671d50c618e.jpg><p>Evan Agostini/Invision/East News</p><p>Angelina recently went <a href=#>blonde</a>, and not everyone was on&nbsp;board with her new look.
