But first, a disclaimer: there is no single Florida accent. The state can roughly be split across the middle, with different accents in the north and the south. And then there’s Miami, which has its own distinctive accent and slang owing to its large Latino population. So, what do Floridians sound like?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-North-Florida-accent>The North Florida accent</h2><p>In the northern part of Florida, the accent is similar to that in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Southern</a> states of the US, like Alabama and Georgia (both of which happen to border Florida).&nbsp;</p><p>You can hear this accent anywhere <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">north of Gainesville</a>, particularly around Tallahassee and the Florida Panhandle. It becomes more prominent as you move into more rural areas. You’re likely to hear words like “y’all” and other sounds characteristics of the Southern accent, like the pronunciation of the /e/ sound in “ten” as /ɪ/, like in “tin.” Hear the accent in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this video</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-South-Florida-accent>The South Florida accent</h2><p>The further south you go in Florida, the less of a Southern accent you’ll hear. How does that work? One word: immigration. From the 1930s onward, people living in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">northeastern</a> states of the US and in Rust Belt cities like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleveland</a>, Pittsburgh and Detroit began moving to South Florida in search of sunshine. And they brought their accents with them. Nowadays, many people who live in the northern parts of the US and in Canada retire to Florida or fly south to spend the winters there (hence their migratory nickname: “snowbirds”).&nbsp;</p><p>In Miami, the population <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled</a> between 1930 and 1950 thanks to immigration from these northern states. Then, after the 1959 Cuban Revolution, Miami became home to increasing numbers of people from Cuba and other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Latin American</a> countries. Fast-forward to today, and the city is 70% Latino. It’s no surprise, then, that the city has a unique accent and dialect heavily influenced by both English and Cuban Spanish. Watch <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this video</a> to listen to some Miami Cubans speaking.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=General-Florida-slang-words>General Florida slang words</h2><p>Here is some Florida <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slang</a> you can use all over the state:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=11><tr><td><strong>Slang</strong></td><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td><strong>Example</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>no-see-ums</td><td>small blood-sucking flies that are difficult to see</td><td>“I hate these no-see-ums!”&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>park in Goofy</td><td>to park far away, inspired by the Goofy parking lot at Walt Disney World, which is furthest away from the entrance</td><td>“Mom!

For example, instead of “take a pill,” you’ll hear “drink a pill,” coming from the Spanish tomar una pastilla (tomar meaning “drink” or “take,” depending on the context). And, rather than “puncture” or “tear a hole,” you’ll hear “open a hole,” which comes from the Spanish abrir un hueco. For example: “That nail opened a hole in my tire.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dale! Come to Florida</h2><p>The beauty of visiting Florida is that you will come across many different accents as you travel across the state, from the Southern drawl of the Panhandle to the Spanish-inspired Miami accent. You’ll also get to learn some words in the Florida accent, such as jit and bih. And if you go anywhere near a pool to have a “Florida bath,” you’ll almost certainly start talking about “no-see-ums.”</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
