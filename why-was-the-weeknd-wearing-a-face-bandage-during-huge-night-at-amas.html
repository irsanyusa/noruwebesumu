The socially distanced live audience and cardboard cutouts filling in the seats at Los Angeles’s Microsoft Theater were just a few new changes. But all eyes were on The Weeknd after he wore a massive bandage face covering for the entire night.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/chubbyabel/status/1330687372548337664</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-weeknd-raises-eyebrows-with-bandaged-face-at-the-ama-s>The Weeknd Raises Eyebrows With Bandaged Face At The AMA’s</h2><p>Actress Taraji P. Henson hosted the event in which The Weeknd won three awards during the live broadcast. He was tied for the most nominations along with Roddy Ricch with eight. He was nominated for Artist of the Year, Favorite Music Video, Favorite Male Artist – Pop/Rock, Favorite Male Artist – Soul/R&B, Favorite Song – Pop/Rock, Favorite Album – Pop/Rock, Favorite Song – Soul/R&B and Favorite Album – Soul/R&B.&nbsp;The AMA’S is a fan-voted award show so fans of some of music’s biggest artists really made sure to participate.</p><p>Accepting each of his awards, The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye sent Twitter into a whirlwind with his face covering. He dedicated his first win of the night to artist Prince. Of course, his fans know that for his latest album aesthetic, he is going for a very specific kind of look. In the music video for the song “Blinding Lights,” he also had bruises and blood on his face. He performed at the MTV VMA’s with this same injured look. But this time at the AMA’s, the look was taken to a whole other level. He performed the song “Save Your Tears” live for the first time ever. All eyes were on his covered face but it has a deeper meaning.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>THE WEEKND RESPONDS TO “CLIMAX” CONTROVERSY & WHY HE RELEASED AN ALBUM AMID CORONAVIRUS</a></strong></p><p>“‘Blinding Lights’ [is about] how you want to see someone at night, and you’re intoxicated, and you’re driving to this person and you’re just blinded by streetlights,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>he said in an interview about his bloody look.</a> “But nothing could stop you from trying to go see that person, because you’re so lonely. I don’t want to ever promote drunk driving, but that’s what the dark undertone is.” Essentially, he wants to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-twitter-was-confused-by-his-latest-look>Twitter Was Confused By His Latest Look</h3><p>Of course viewers of the AMA’s were not all familiar with The Weeknd’s unique look and aesthetic.
