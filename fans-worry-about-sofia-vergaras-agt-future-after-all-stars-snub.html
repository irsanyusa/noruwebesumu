One particular detail from the episode has some fans wondering about Vergara’s future on the series.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-was-sofia-vergara-cut-out-of-agt-all-stars>Was Sofia Vergara Cut Out of AGT: All-Stars?</h2><p>Singer Jimmie Herrod was one of the contestants featured during Monday night’s All-Stars premiere. Herrod earned the Golden Buzzer from Vergara during Season 16. Although the show flashed back to Herrod’s audition, it overlooked his Golden Buzzer moment.</p><p>Instead, the flashback focused on judge Simon Cowell’s initial dislike of Herrod’s audition song, “Tomorrow” from Annie, and how Herrod’s performance changed his mind about it. Vergara was shown sitting next to Cowell, but the moment she hit the Golden Buzzer was left out.</p><p>A Reddit user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>pointed out</a> that this is in contrast to the show’s clip packages for fellow Golden Buzzers Caly Bevier and Light Balance Kids. In both cases, Cowell and guest judge Ellie Kemper, respectively, were showing hitting the Golden Buzzer for the acts.</p><p>The user wrote that they thought this was “not a good sign for her future on the show.” Fans have been wondering why Vergara wasn’t part of the All-Stars panel, and an official reason has not been given for her absence.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHY ISN’T SOFIA VERGARA JUDGING ‘AGT: ALL-STARS’?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5AtKHfdoz0</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-should-fans-be-worried-about-vergara-s-future>Should Fans Be Worried About Vergara’s Future?</h2><p>On the Reddit thread about Vergara’s apparent snub, one other user wrote that they “noticed it as well,” adding, “I felt like it was disrespectful towards Sofia kind of.”</p><p>However, other users weren’t as quick to assume that the absence of her Golden Buzzer meant anything bad. One user wrote that people are “making a big deal of nothing” and pointed out that Howie Mandel and Heidi Klum weren’t involved in AGT: Extreme, but they still returned. Another user shared that they “don’t think they are acting like she [Vergara] didn’t exist.”</p><p>One thing is clear — a lot of fans miss Vergara on All-Stars. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Talent Recap’s article</a> about her absence has inspired several people to comment how much they wish she was part of the panel.
