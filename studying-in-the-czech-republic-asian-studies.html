The emerging geopolitical and economic significance of Asia – and its sub-regions – at the beginning of the 21st century have reshaped our global economic and political environment.</p><p>Study programmes in <a href=#>Asian Studies</a> aim to provide students with a breadth and depth of knowledge of the region, encompassing the fields of geography, culture, history, ethnicity, religion, and language, in order to help them gain a more profound understanding of the societies of individual states and their interrelations.</p><p><strong>Here is a list of Asian study programmes taught in English in the Czech Republic:</strong></p><h3><a title="Bachelor study programmes in the Czech Republic" href=#>Bachelor’s Study Programmes</a>:</h3><h4>· International Relations – Asian Studies at <a href=#>Metropolitan University Prague</a></h4><p>The students of the International Relations – Asian Studies and the International Relations – European Studies programmes are registered in a joint study programme of International Relations. The programme splits into two specializations during the fourth semester – into Asian Studies and European Studies – students choose themselves which one they will follow. The deadline for the decision is the end of the third semester but students already indicate one the specializations in their application for studies for the purpose of estimate of interest in both specializations – nevertheless, this choice is not binding and students can later change it.</p><p>The programme focuses not only on international relations on the general level but also offers a deep insight into territorial aspects of international relations in the Asian region. The courses are taught in English by both Czech and foreign academics and experts.</p><h3><a title="Doctoral study programmes in the Czech Republic" href=#>Doctoral study programmes</a>:</h3><h4>· Asian Studies at the Faculty of Arts of Palacký University</h4><p>The Department of Asian Studies at Palacký University Olomouc offers a 4-year PhD programme in Asian Studies in both English and Czech languages. The department offers language instruction in Cantonese, Chinese, Indonesian/Malay, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, Uzbek, Tajik Persian and Vietnamese in its BA and MA programs.</p><h4>· Asian History and Culture at the Faculty of Arts at <a href=#>Charles University</a></h4><p>Graduates of the doctoral programme in Asian History and Culture are highly qualified specialists in the area of their specialization.
