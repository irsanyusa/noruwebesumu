Snoop served as a Mega Mentor in Season 20, while Bublé was an advisor on Blake Shelton’s team all the way back in Season 3 of the show.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Snoop called McEntire the “queen” of the show, adding, “I can be the king that brings the style, the funk, the fun.” Watching those two interact during the new season is sure to be fun.
