Adding that the pressure of being a young pop star constantly in the public eye and the distance between them on the road led him to stray from his devoted girlfriend.</p><p>"We were working out how to be in a relationship, how to be ourselves, who we were, in the middle of having people judge our relationship through the media. I think that really messed my head up too," the 21-year-old told the mag.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>However, Justin’s choices after that are what made it impossible for Selena to trust him. "Because then, it’s like trust and all this other stuff that starts messing with your mind,"&nbsp; says Justin. "You’re on the road. And there are beautiful women&nbsp;on the road. And you’re just getting yourself into trouble," he went on to say.</p><p>With Justin admitting to his flaws, could this&nbsp; be a major sign that he’s growing up and wants to try it again with Selena? He's been doing a lot of work on himself lately: apologizing to fans, admitting he <a href=# id=4b5d912f-ff5c-5297-a024-dcc8eaddcea4>ruined</a>&nbsp;his relationship with his mom and ending his longtime feud&nbsp;with&nbsp; actor, <strong>Seth Rogan</strong>.</p><p>Now, he and Selena are back on good terms. He calls her his 'homey' and he supported &nbsp;her at the&nbsp;<strong>Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show</strong>. Maybe all of this means he’s ready to be the man she needs, and we couldn’t be more excited to see where this goes… right!?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGajraOptq95waKcm52iYsCqusaeqWaemaOurbjYZpidpZmpwG7AzmaaoZ2Rqbavs4yopWarlaGyr62MoKamnapkhq5%2BlaShcQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
