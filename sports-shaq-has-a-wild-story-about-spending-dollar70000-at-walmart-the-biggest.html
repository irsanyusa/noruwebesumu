"So they already got the apartment set up, and I ain't got nothing. I ain't got no towels, I ain't got no pots and pans ... I'm Walmart's biggest customer ... Pans, socks, underwears, tank tops, TVs, printers, computers."</p><p>O'Neal said his credit card was declined at checkout. Moments later, American Express called him saying somebody tried to spend $70,000 at Walmart on his card. O'Neal had to confirm it was him.</p><p>"The security team from American Express calls me, 'Hey man, somebody stole your credit card. They're at Walmart,'" O'Neal said. "I said, 'No sir, that's me.' The guy goes, 'What the f--- are you buying?!'"</p><p>O'Neal recently revealed on HBO that <a href=# id=4fbc1dc5-c5d9-553b-b36d-7d2cc84d321c>he now makes more money off of endorsements</a> than he did in his playing career. Perhaps he can add Walmart to a collection that already includes Krispy Kreme, Gold Bond, Icy Hot, Ring, and more.</p><p>Watch the clip below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9GtqmarmJa%2BbrTArGSaZaeeuaV50q2mq7Fdlq%2BwwdNmqqmdnpm2r7OMnaalpJGnhHF8j2lkmqxdrK6tucCrq2asmJp6o7XGoJysrF%2BbtaS8kp%2Bj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
