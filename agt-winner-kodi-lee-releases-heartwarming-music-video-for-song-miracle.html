As Lee sings on the inspiring song, “Every day’s a miracle / Every hour wonderful.” He first <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">teased the music video</a> in early October.</p><p>The new clip starts with Lee playing piano in a sparkly black jacket as he sings the first verse. The video then cuts to shots of Lee being held by his mom Tina as a baby. There’s even footage of Lee when he was little playing a keyboard and singing for a crowd, as well as clips of him and his siblings performing together.</p><p>Other moments from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> include Lee playing piano while wearing round sunglasses and a mirrored jacket, as well as a shot of him outside under a cloudy blue sky.

However, he announced last month that he’s taking a temporary leave from the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to speculation</a> that he could be competing on the upcoming All Stars season.</p><p>Lee announced that he would be absent from the Las Vegas show from October 26 to November 9. Since All Stars is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">currently in production</a>, could this mean Lee is competing on the spin-off? If he is, he’ll be up against Detroit Youth Choir, who took second place during his season. The group has confirmed their involvement.</p><p>Regardless, we can’t wait to hear whatever Lee has in store. After hearing him sing so many amazing covers on AGT, it’s great to hear an original song from him. Fingers crossed there’s more to come soon.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_JordinSparks_BrandonArmstrong_ABC_Eric-McCandless.jpg alt="Jordin Sparks Shares Parting Words After ‘DWTS’ Elimination" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kodi Lee</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZq%2BZo7umvoykpp2hXaGypnnRnqOemaOawG60xJqpra%2BRp7qqusZmpK6rmZh6t7XDnqZmnp%2BnerS7zaBkpqGilrCtsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
