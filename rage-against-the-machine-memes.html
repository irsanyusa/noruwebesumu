After making his feelings known on <a href=#>Twitter</a> about how he may have been accidentally listening to pointed songs for years, other Twitter users have been mercilessly roasting them for it, and the band’s guitarist <a href=#>Tom Morello</a> joined in the fun.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It started when a Twitter user named Scott Castaneda tweeted at Morello on Tuesday night. “I used to be a fan until your political opinions came out. Music is my sanctuary and the last thing I want to hear is political BS when I’m listening to music,” Castaneda wrote, seemingly unaware that he had been listening to one of the more popular political rock groups the whole time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Morello responded to his evidently former fan’s query. “Scott!! What music of mine were you a fan of that DIDN’T contain “political BS”? I need to know so I can delete it from the catalog,” he tweeted.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Scott!!

While Castaneda told the outlet that he “rarely” went on Twitter, he now appears to have deleted his account entirely and may have missed some of the 10,500 replies his tweet garnered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucGVmf3eDjquYoJ1dlrSitc2sq2asmJp6rq3CoaCnnV2isq6x0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
