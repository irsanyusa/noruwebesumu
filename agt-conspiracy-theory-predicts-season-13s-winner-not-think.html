With 14 semi-finalists already selected and 12 more quarter-finalists set to compete next week, 26 acts remain in the running for the coveted million dollar prize. But a conspiracy theory from 2016, may hold the answer as to who the champion will be.</strong></p><p>Back in September 2016,&nbsp;<strong>Grace VanderWaal</strong> was crowned victor of AGT Season 11. Grace was the show’s first female winner since Season 1, when another child singer, <strong>Bianca Ryan</strong>, took home the grand prize.</p><p>Immediately after Grace’s big win, Reddit user <a href=# class=broken_link>donut-express</a> took to the site with an interesting observation.</p><p><a href=#>THEORY</a><br>by<a href=#>u/donut-express</a> in<a href=#>agt</a></p><p>This post was clearly made in jest, but the crazy thing is…it turned out to be correct. One year later, singing ventriloquist <strong>Darci Lynne Farmer</strong> was crowned the champion of Season 12.</p><p>Season 3’s winner was the late <strong>Neal E. Boyd</strong>, who was an opera singer. The only opera singer in Season 13 to advance past auditions was <strong>Daniel Emmet</strong>. When he was eliminated in Judge Cuts, it seemed this “decade parallels” theory was officially dead. But then it was announced Daniel had been selected as one of the season’s quarter-finals wildcard acts. Now that he’s back in the running, we might still see the pattern continue for the third season in a row.</p><p>So could Daniel Emmet be our Season 13 champion? He did get a lot of focus during auditions and Judge Cuts (being one of several singing acts granted one of Simon Cowell’s infamous re-do’s) and a lot of people were clamoring for him to return when he was eliminated in the latter round.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>And, I mean, the theory has been bang-on so far; you have to admit it’s a little eerie that the prediction of a singing ventriloquist winning last season came true when we’d barely had any of those on AGT.</p><p>Of course, these theories and speculations are all in good fun and are just funny coincidences…probably. In all seriousness, my money is still on <strong>Courtney Hadwin</strong> to take it home this year. But if it does turn out to be Daniel, I know I’ll <a href=#>automatically be betting on a country artist</a> to win Season 14.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ustheduo-on-agt.jpg alt="Everything You Should Know About ‘AGT’ Fan Favorite Us The Duo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZpufo8CxtdGamrJlpJ2ysL7YZqernZSesLW%2FjKycmqufo3pyf9JmrqKmnpq%2FbrrOrWStoJmjuHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
