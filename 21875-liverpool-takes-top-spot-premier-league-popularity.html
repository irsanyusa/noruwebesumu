One quarter of Brits (26%) see the club in unfavourable terms (quite possibly Manchester United or Everton supporters) and 34% have a neutral opinion. Only 5% of Brits say they have never heard of the team.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Premier20league20popular-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In second place are surprise 2015/2016 league champions Leicester City, liked by 30% of Britons. Unlike third-placed Manchester United and fourth-placed Arsenal, both of whom are also liked by 28% of Britons, they are not particularly reviled, with only 14% having a negative view of the Foxes compared to 36% for the Red Devils and 32% for the Gunners.</p><p>In fact, the 36% of Brits who dislike Manchester United make them the most disliked team in the Premier League, ahead of Chelsea in second on 34% and Arsenal in third.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Premier20league20unpopular-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>While Manchester City dominated the Premier League last season, winning the trophy in commanding fashion, the 27% of people who like them means they'll have to settle for sixth place in the popularity table.</p><p>At the other end of the popularity table, looking set for relegation are Cardiff City and Watford, liked by only 11% and 14% of Britons (but also disliked by 20% and 19% respectively).</p><p>Competition to stay out of the third relegation slot is fierce â€“ the current occupiers are Fulham who are liked by only 17% of Brits.
