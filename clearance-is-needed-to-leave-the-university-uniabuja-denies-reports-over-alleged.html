According to Yakoob, the allegations are an attempt to skip clearance fees and short-change the University.</p><p>It could be recalled that there have been reports circulating on the social media of illegal payment of clearance fees by some graduating students of University of Abuja before enrolling for NYSC programme.</p><p>Yakoob explained that the verification Department in charge of clearance had all the facts at its disposal. He added that more than 80% of the students had paid, while 15% were yet to pay.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“There is nothing illegal about the fees and the University is very clear on this. The students whose names are not on the accepted Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) jamb list must pay such a fee.</p><p>“While some of those students paid, many others do not, often time, in an attempt to short-change the University.</p><p>“Though they always thought they had scaled through, at the critical time they need clearance to leave the University, they are made to pay that sum because the verification unit which is in charge of this clearance has all the facts at its disposal.</p><p>“And most students are aware of this and are complying. At the moment, more than 80 per cent of the students have paid, leaving just 15 per cent who are expected to pay,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXykuMSaqZqmk5p6qr%2BMp5yenJWZerW7jKWcmq6VYsGpsYyupaKulafAqsDYZqynoZGXwqutjJ2cp6GVqHqzsc%2Boqa2rXaTDpr6MmqOlnZeasXDCk26cnZqa</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
