According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>psychologists</a>, having a&nbsp;sister improves your mental stability and overall development. Children who grow up&nbsp;with sisters around them are happier and become better-adjusted adults.</p><p><b>Bright Side </b>believes that having an&nbsp;older sister is&nbsp;truly a&nbsp;blessing which helps you in&nbsp;many ways and in&nbsp;every <a href=# title=part data-link=tag>part</a> of&nbsp;your life. Here’s how:</p><p><h2>1. She lowers your chance of&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;divorce in&nbsp;the future.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb7/311/2d7f0e58f5b1171665b16250d5.jpg><p><a href=#>A&nbsp;study from Ohio State University</a> found evidence that children with siblings had a&nbsp;lower chance of&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;divorce in&nbsp;the future. One aspect of&nbsp;this surprising discovery is&nbsp;that having a&nbsp;sister <strong>makes you a&nbsp;more mature and less self-centered adult</strong>. Your early childhood experiences have a&nbsp;huge impact on&nbsp;your development as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult. Kids with siblings need to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;share and deal with conflicts very early&nbsp;on, so&nbsp;this upbringing is&nbsp;very relevant when dealing with a&nbsp;romantic partner. Having a&nbsp;big sis as&nbsp;your friend growing up&nbsp;has a&nbsp;profound impact on&nbsp;every area of&nbsp;your life.</p><p><h2>2. She’s the reason why your parents are more lenient toward you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b16/54d/34a0345651a3a260f15e27214e.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you think growing up&nbsp;was hard for you, believe it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, it&nbsp;was way harder for your sister. A&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> has found that parents are much <strong>more strict and harsh toward their firstborns</strong> when compared to&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the siblings. First-time parents are all about rules and too many expectations, but they are reduced when another child is&nbsp;born and gradually, they get more lenient. So, if&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;older sister, that’s another reason you need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;grateful to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>3. She cheers you on&nbsp;and helps you achieve your goals.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1fe/63e/932f9b5e1d9a9e99d6ef48cbc8.jpg><p>She has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things to&nbsp;teach you that you haven’t experienced yet. You’ll always have an&nbsp;ally and someone to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;to. She <strong>inspires you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;better and to&nbsp;strive toward your goals</strong>. Growing up&nbsp;with sisters makes you more <a href=#>ambitious</a> and independent. It’s a&nbsp;normal <a href=#>process</a> for the younger ones to&nbsp;imitate their older siblings as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;their social and cognitive development. Even if&nbsp;you’re not aware, your big sister is&nbsp;fundamental in&nbsp;shaping your personality.</p><p><h2>4. She improves your mental health by&nbsp;being there for you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfe/832/9d5de45492bf730c2640fc5690.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According to&nbsp;science</a>, growing up&nbsp;with sisters reduces negative feelings in&nbsp;young teenagers. You’re less likely to&nbsp;feel lonely, guilty, and unloved. Sibling affection is&nbsp;super important in&nbsp;emotional development and <strong>can help curb <a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a></strong>. It&nbsp;has also been found that having a&nbsp;sister makes you a&nbsp;kinder, more <a href=# title=empathetic data-link=tag>empathetic</a> person.</p><p><h2>5. She helps you discover the meaning of&nbsp;unconditional love.</h2></p><p>She is&nbsp;someone who always has your back. Even as&nbsp;you grow older, that bond will continue to&nbsp;be&nbsp;of&nbsp;the <a href=#>utmost importance</a> in&nbsp;your <strong>overall well-being</strong> and the longer-lasting relationship you will have in&nbsp;your lifetime. You always have support from her and someone to&nbsp;talk&nbsp;to. That makes you feel loved and cherished, and also it&nbsp;teaches you how to&nbsp;better <a href=#>communicate your feelings</a>. You’ll always be&nbsp;more comfortable sharing something with her than with your parents, and she’ll certainly be&nbsp;a&nbsp;better listener.</p><p>Most of&nbsp;all, you will always have a&nbsp;ride-or-die best friend, someone that knows you so&nbsp;intimately that she can tell what you’re thinking just by&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;you. That is&nbsp;the most precious gift and something to&nbsp;cherish every day. You are so&nbsp;fortunate to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;big sister who loves you.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you agree that having a&nbsp;big sister is&nbsp;the best? Do&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;older sister that means the world to&nbsp;you? Share this with her to&nbsp;let her know how grateful you are that you have her in&nbsp;your life!</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in March 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyypq6qXaS5pbHRZqqiq6Sav2610mamp51dpLNuwMeeZKano6l6qrnPqKmtmZ6perGxzqmjnmWZo3q6u9SrZKWhlpp6eIWTbG5rZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
