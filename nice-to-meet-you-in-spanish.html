The last thing you want is to be rude when meeting a new friend, colleague or business contact. This is even more important when learning Spanish, as you’ll notice that people across Latin America tend to be quite polite. Here’s the good news: There are in fact many ways to say “Nice to meet you” in Spanish.&nbsp;</p><p>This may seem like overkill, but it pays to have options. After all, conversations are dynamic and you never know exactly how they’ll play out. Ready to be armed with different ways to say “Nice to meet you” in Spanish? Let’s dive in.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=At-the-beginning:-How-to-say-“Nice-to-meet-you”-in-Spanish->At the beginning: How to say “Nice to meet you” in Spanish&nbsp;</h2><p>Let’s start with the standard way in which an introductory conversation often unfolds. Someone introduces themselves and you respond, like so:&nbsp;</p><p>Yo: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hola</a>. Soy Alison.” (Hi. I’m Alison.)</p><p>Tú: “Mucho gusto.” / “Encantado/a.” / “Un placer.” (Nice to meet you. / Enchanted. / A pleasure.)</p><p>So, what comes next? Here are a number of responses that all roughly equate to “Nice to meet you” in Spanish:</p><ul><li>Un gusto en conocerlo/la (Nice to meet you)</li><li>Mucho gusto (Nice to meet you)</li><li>Un gusto (A joy/pleasure)</li><li>Encantado/a (Enchanted)</li><li>Encantado/a de conocerlo/la (Enchanted to meet you)</li><li>Es un placer conocerlo/la (It’s a pleasure to meet you)</li><li>Un placer (A pleasure)</li><li>Que tal? (How’s it going?) Note: This one is quite casual, and probably not best for meeting the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">President</a>.</li></ul><p>As you can see, there are shorter versions as well as longer, more polite versions. Our advice? If you’re a beginner, start with the shorter ones (they’re easier to memorize) and work your way up to the longer versions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=In-the-middle:-“Nice-to-meet-you,-too”-in-Spanish>In the middle: “Nice to meet you, too” in Spanish</h2><p>Now, imagine you’re in the middle of a conversation or exchange. You’ve introduced yourself in Spanish, someone has said “Nice to meet you,” and you need to respond:</p><p>Tú: “Hola. Soy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandra</a>.” (Hi. I’m Alexandra.)</p><p>Yo: “Soy Alison. Mucho gusto, Alejandra.” (I’m Alison. Nice to meet you.)</p><p>Tú: “Igualmente.” (Likewise.)</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><p>Here are some other phrases you can use to respond:</p><ul><li>Igualmente (Likewise)</li><li>Igual (Likewise)</li><li>Lo mismo (Same here)</li><li>El gusto es mío (The joy is mine)</li><li>El placer es mío (The pleasure is mine)</li><li>He escuchado mucho sobre usted. (I’ve heard so much about you)</li></ul><p>You may have noticed that He escuchado mucho sobre usted (I’ve heard so much about you) uses the formal usted. It can be difficult to know when to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tutear</a> (to use the informal tú) with someone. Upon first meeting, it’s best to be polite and formal unless they are clearly younger than you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=At-the-end:-“It-was-nice-to-meet-you”-in-Spanish>At the end: “It was nice to meet you” in Spanish</h2><p>So long, farewell, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">auf Wiedersehen</a>, goodbye! The conversation is wrapping up and you’re saying your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">goodbyes</a>. Good manners in Spanish dictate that you should reiterate your pleasure in meeting your new friend or colleague by using the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">past tense</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">present perfect</a> verb tense:</p><p>Yo: “Lamentablemente, tengo que irme.” (Unfortunately, I have to leave.)&nbsp;</p><p>Tú: “Fue un placer.” (It was a pleasure.)</p><p>Here are various ways to say “Nice to meet you” in Spanish when ending a conversation:</p><ul><li>Fue un gusto a conocerlo/la (It was a joy to meet you)</li><li>Fue un gusto (It was a joy)</li><li>Fue un placer conocerlo/la (It was a pleasure to meet you)</li><li>Fue un placer (It was a pleasure)</li><li>Fue un gusto haberlo/la conocido (It was a joy to have met you)</li><li>Fue un placer haberlo/la conocido (It was a pleasure to have met you)</li><li>Has sido un gusto (It has been a joy)</li><li>Has sido un placer (It has been a pleasure)</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fue un placer!</h2><p>In other words, it has truly been a pleasure! Learning to say “Nice to meet you” in Spanish isn’t always easy. It often requires a review of local etiquette, as well as a choice between using formal or informal Spanish. Remember, conversations are dynamic and require flexibility when juggling aspects such as context and form.
