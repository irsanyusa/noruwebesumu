And they truly love working with each other.</p><p>Recently, the duo reunited <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>via Instagram</a> for the 20th anniversary of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their famous rom-coms. There, they shared what impact their experience had on&nbsp;the filming process. Not to&nbsp;mention how they brought their onscreen sweet kisses to&nbsp;life.</p><p><h2>McConaughey helped Kate Hudson to&nbsp;deal with her divorce</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/23d/af8/ec56385377a4bbf34fa5d46a50.jpg><p>The second time they worked together, <a href=#>McConaughey</a> helped his beautiful partner get through hearing the news that her <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> had been finalized from her then-husband Chris Robinson. This was a&nbsp;hard time for her but with all the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>support</a> from McConaughey it&nbsp;was much easier for her to&nbsp;cope with all the troubles she had to&nbsp;face at&nbsp;the moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f71/62a/2899d55bf79321034b45244305.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Fool’s Gold</i></a> was their second time working together, after 2003’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>How to&nbsp;Lose a&nbsp;Guy in&nbsp;10&nbsp;Days</i></a>. And the actress recalls that, at&nbsp;that time, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;that set with Matthew was just the best.</p><p>They were on&nbsp;a&nbsp;boat that was going out to&nbsp;the outer reef. McConaughey knew the situation<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>,</a> so&nbsp;he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;be&nbsp;near and cheer Hudson up. She admits that he&nbsp;truly helped her to&nbsp;get through that difficult <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>transition</a>.</p><p><h2>Being on&nbsp;set together was the best remedy for her&nbsp;— and their bond helped the on-screen chemistry</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08c/bd6/48dfe657e4a2092d2336b353bb.jpg><p>MCMULLAN CO/EAST NEWS</p><p>McConaughey and his shooting process were the best distraction for her. Hudson knew his process, how he&nbsp;dove into the stuff, and how crazy and wild it&nbsp;could get. But she loved that magic, so&nbsp;she let self just go&nbsp;with the flow.</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Interstellar</i></a> actor himself has a&nbsp;happy life with his wife <a href=#>Camila Alves</a> and their 3&nbsp;kids. Yet, on&nbsp;set, he&nbsp;has quite a&nbsp;different approach to&nbsp;filming, especially all the “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>steamy moments</a>.” McConaughey says, “Everything else was like, ‘Swim up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the top, the sharks almost ate you, you just fell from a&nbsp;plane from 300&nbsp;feet, tread water and before you catch your breath, kiss.’”</p><p><h2>But they respect their partners, nevertheless</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a1e/b45/b8016b5be3b1167971595ded52.jpg><p>Hudson, on&nbsp;the other hand, says that their <a href=#>kisses</a> on&nbsp;the big screen are not as&nbsp;intimate as&nbsp;they might be&nbsp;in&nbsp;real life. She keeps it&nbsp;professional though and admits that they actually try “to&nbsp;create something that evokes something in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>certain way</a>.”</p><p>That might not be&nbsp;exactly the way they would necessarily do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;real life but still, the actors respect their partners. So&nbsp;when they have&nbsp;to, they kiss nicely and spread that chemistry through the screen to&nbsp;touch the audience’s hearts.</p><p><h2>They deny any off-screen romance</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d7/056/fc67fd5c9186a9dbfca39828e6.jpg><p>Their <a href=#>chemistry</a> looked so&nbsp;authentic that many fans even started questioning whether the duo had a&nbsp;relationship in&nbsp;real life. And the <i>Interstellar </i>actor confessed he’s had certain crushes, despite taking it&nbsp;as&nbsp;just a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;acting.</p><p>“Maybe we&nbsp;had certain crushes on&nbsp;each other at&nbsp;certain times,” he&nbsp;said, “but we&nbsp;always just kind of&nbsp;kept it&nbsp;professional. Or&nbsp;maybe we&nbsp;were dating somebody seriously outside of&nbsp;ourselves at&nbsp;the time and we&nbsp;both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>respected</a> that for the other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7be/333/2c721d50739b1f89209834f7fc.jpg><p>Still, that’s not the only thing that resonates with the viewers and the actors themselves. They admit that they are sensitive people but that they also leave room for a&nbsp;drop of&nbsp;spontaneity and try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;natural on&nbsp;set. And what’s great is&nbsp;that they both truly share this phenomenal work ethic.</p><p>They both feel free and do&nbsp;not constrict themselves to&nbsp;an&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;what they’re supposed to&nbsp;do. When they work together, it&nbsp;sometimes looks like a&nbsp;<a href=#>real-life</a> relationship. They may be&nbsp;going in&nbsp;one direction, but then Hudson may think, “I’m going to&nbsp;throw him off a&nbsp;little bit. Let’s see what happens if&nbsp;I&nbsp;do a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sharp right</a>.” And she does!</p><p><h2>Best friends, but with different approaches to&nbsp;married life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/018/541/a6b27454e6865cd5a6a6416be8.jpg><p>What’s more interesting is&nbsp;how different both actors are in&nbsp;their personal lives. McConaughey is&nbsp;a&nbsp;family guy while Hudson managed to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;seriously strong unit with her 3&nbsp;children who have 3&nbsp;different fathers.</p><p>She knows it&nbsp;might not look traditional from the outside, but on&nbsp;the inside, it’s all theirs. “I’m not interested in&nbsp;forcing some conventional idea of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>love</a> or&nbsp;marriage,” says the actress who seems to&nbsp;share this freedom through the big screen with all of&nbsp;us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ab/7e7/8e595d502792879b520ac374f7.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLiiwMRmn66co6S7br7Er5yapKNitbDDjKGcq2WZo7K3tdOamaWdXZi1prnIrKursV2ku26%2FwqucnqZdrLa1tIymmK2smJrEbrnCnKanmaWctabFjJqdn52TqcBuwMeeoKtloJq%2FtLvNmqNmpJmbsm6EkGpvbW5f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
