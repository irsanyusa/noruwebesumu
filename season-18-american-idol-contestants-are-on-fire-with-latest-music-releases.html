The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Season 18</a> American Idol contestants are doing just the opposite. They have been releasing their own original music regularly since the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most unconventional season of the show ever.</a> You need to hear some of the recent music releases from this insanely talented bunch.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-makayla-phillips>1. Makayla Phillips</h2><p>Fans were delighted to see Makayla Phillips return for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 19 comeback</a> episode of American Idol. She previously made it to the Top 11 on Season 18, which was a shock to fans of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Heidi Klum’s ‘AGT’ Golden Buzzer.</a> One thing we learned about Makayla through her time on talent shows is that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>she is unstoppable.</a></p><p>Her song “Renegade Jane (Don’t Want You)” will be released on May 7. She teased the single on Instagram in a very short video hitting a whistle-tone note that only she can.

Jonny West</h3><p>Remember when Jonny West sang his song “Makin’ Love” during his American Idol audition and knocked our socks off with his rapping skills? This Top 5 American Idol finalist is back with the same incredible sound in his single “NUMBER.” The sexy music video for this song is everything!</p><p>It totally makes sense why Jonny wasn’t a part of The Comeback on Season 19. he’s busy doing his own thing and his fans are absolutely loving it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-julia-gargano>3. Julia Gargano</h3><p>Julia Gargano set the bar for songwriting on Season 18 of American Idol. After making it to the Top 7 and being eliminated despite her strong fanbase, fans waited to see what Julia was going to do next. The New York native signed a deal with 19 Recordings after the show.</p><p>Her latest release <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Strangers”</a> is an all-too-relatable tune about the one that got away. This song will give you goosebumps and totally have you in your feels. The music video for the song will be out on May 7.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-sophia-james>4.

His growing fanbase also loves his song “Change” which we predict will reach 1 million streams <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Spotify</a> by the end of this year.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-nick-merico>6.
