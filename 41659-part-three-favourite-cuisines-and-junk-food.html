This is followed by Chinese food (46%) and British (43%). Indian is liked by four in ten Britons (41%), particularly more by men (47%) than women (36%). Mexican (13%), Thai (12%) and American (11%) cuisines are the next most popular, while French – considered to be one of the world’s best cuisines – is preferred by just 5% of Britons.</p><p>A closer look at the results shows that Italian food is the favourite for the majority of those aged 16-24 (58%) and 25-39 (56%), while approaching half in other age groups (47-48%). It is also slightly more popular with women (54%) than men (48%). Italian is also the most popular food choice for vegetarians, with two thirds (67%) rating it as their favourite, significantly higher than non-vegetarians.</p><p>Junk food is often blamed for obesity problems in the UK. The YouGov Food Study finds almost half of people (47%) say they eat ‘junk food’ a least once a week, including 7% who do so every day. One in five (21%) consume it once or twice a month, while 17% have it less often.</p><p>One in eight Britons (12%) say they don’t eat junk food at all.</p><p>Two-thirds of Britons aged 16-39 (66-69%) eat junk food at least once a week, falling to 47% among those in their forties and fifties, and just a quarter (23%) of those aged 60 and older.</p><p>When it comes to Britons’ favourite junk foods, chocolate (37%), crisps (32%) and takeaway pizza (31%) are the most popular. Hamburgers are a favoured choice for 18%, followed by French fries (16%).</p><p>There are some considerable gender divides in terms of favourite junk food. One in four men (24%) prefer hamburgers, while this applies to only 13% of women. Men are also more likely than women to like takeaway pizza: 36% vs 26%. On the other hand, women are more likely than men to prefer chocolate (43% vs 31%) and crisps (35% vs 28%).</p><p>Takeaway pizza is notably more popular with those under 40 (41-42%) than those in their 40s and 50s (30%), or those 60 and older (15%).</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsYWuCennPmqmtZaSdv6axjJ%2BYr6elp7a1sYycrKKrmaOytHnAp5tmoqWjuG6yzqib</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
