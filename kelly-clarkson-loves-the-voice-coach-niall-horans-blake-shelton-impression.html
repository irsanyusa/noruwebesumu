During his appearance, he showed off his Blake Shelton impression, and Clarkson admitted that she thought he won The X Factor.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-niall-horan-impersonates-blake-shelton-for-kelly-clarkson>Niall Horan Impersonates Blake Shelton for Kelly Clarkson</h2><p>Clarkson told Horan that “it’s nice to have new coaches” on The Voice Season 23, adding that Horan and fellow new coach Chance the Rapper are “so good.” She also shared how much she loved the fact that Horan “jumped right into giving Shelton crap.”</p><p>Horan admitted, “I love winding him up.” Clarkson shared that it “made me feel really good” to have backup, as she’s known to give Shelton a hard time. Horan told her she’s a pro, and she responded, “Practice makes perfect.”</p><p>The host also pointed out that Horan does a great impression of Shelton, and she asked him to share it. Horan said that Shelton told him he sounded like Forrest Gump. Clarkson told him he doesn’t, adding of Shelton, “He’s dumb.”</p><p>Horan then shared a few words in Shelton’s southern drawl, saying, “This is my last season on The Voice. I want you to be on my team. And I hate Kelly Clarkson.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NIALL HORAN LOOKS BACK AT HOW KATY PERRY SAVED HIM ON ‘X FACTOR UK’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-clarkson-thought-one-direction-won-the-x-factor>Clarkson Thought One Direction won The X Factor</h2><p>Horan’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">group One Direction</a> formed on The X Factor UK and came in third place. However, Clarkson admitted during her interview with Horan that she thought they had won. She was surprised when he told her they didn’t.</p><p>“I mean, ’cause you did, in life,” Clarkson said of her belief that they won. “‘Cause I didn’t watch. I just knew that’s where you came from.”</p><p>Clarkson also said she liked the idea of competing on a talent show with a group, because she said she was “very lonely off the top” when she won American Idol. Horan said he and his groupmates were “so lucky” to have each other.</p><p>Horan and Clarkson now have the same pitch for The Voice contestants, which is that they both have experience competing on talent shows. We’ll have to see how it all goes down when the new season premieres March 6 on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_AveryDixon_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpg alt="‘AGT All-Stars’ Standout Avery Dixon to Embark on His First Out of Country Tour" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlnKTDpr%2BMrZ%2BeZaaktqSxjJymmpuYYruqrculZKGnopa7tHnBpZiknV2otaa406ilZqGdpb%2Bmv9Kipqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
